- Use case 1: 	only one endpoint recorded, so 1 terminal involved into recording

- Use case 2: 	Both of endpoints are recorded.	In this case CUCM initilizes recording for 2 terminals
				but sniffer supresses one of them to eliminate duplications.
				
- Use case 3:	Recorded called party has a bad line recording configuration
