Hello Jens,

We came across and the issue and it  looks similar to this one pointed out in the openssl community http://www.mail-archive.com/openssl-users@openssl.org/msg65597.html

We are  still investigating and will let you know

Hi Prem,

our dev team extracted a snipped from the source for you:
In this class there is the sendBytes() function. It is uses java SSLSocketFactory to create SSLSocket.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Hello Jens,

We looked into the CCM logs.
We see the following error :

07/26/2012 08:43:16.534 CCM|HandleSSLError - TLS protocol error(ssl reason code=block type is not 01 [106]),lib=rsa routines
[4],fun=RSA_padding_check_PKCS1_type_1 [112], errno=12 for
192956|<CLID::StandAloneCluster><NID::192.168.5.17><CT::0,0,0,0.0><IP::>
192956|<DE
V::><LVL::Error><MASK::0800>

It looks like in the ClientKeyExchange , encrypted pre-master key by the client is getting decrypted by the server to a different value that is causing the final decrypt error at server side. Not sure if it's feasible , but is it possible to get code snippet on the application server side code that does the TLS ?

Can you confirm again , the application server code is in Java or C++ ? In other words , For TLS , are you  using  openssl or java security providers ?

Thank you,

Hello Team,

My apology for replying late.
We have been working on this issue with the engineer.We used the Customer key and certificate to reproduce the issue. But Call Manager does not complain and the connection goes fine. At this point , we are a bit clueless what could be going wrong with the Server code that Cu is using. Can you get me the Call Manager logs and I can check if it gives any idea.

Hi Prem,

here is the reply from our Dev-Team:

Provider [0] = SUN version 1.6

Provider [1] = SunRsaSign version 1.5

Provider [2] = SunJSSE version 1.6

Provider [3] = SunJCE version 1.6

Provider [4] = SunJGSS version 1.0

Provider [5] = SunSASL version 1.5

Provider [6] = XMLDSig version 1.0

Provider [7] = SunPCSC version 1.6

Provider [8] = BC version 1.44


For creating APAS self-signed certificate we use third-party API, it is called "BouncyCastle", it is a free magic tool. the last item in the list:
Provider [8]

This is the Provider clas in Java:
org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider()

But I think this BC provider based on Sun Crypto Tool, so I expect indirectly we use some others as well.


Is this the information you needed? Let me know if you have questions.

Hello Jens,

We imported the Application Server certificate to our CUCM and attempted an openssl handshake with our CUCM from another server using the your certificate and private key:

> openssl s_client -connect vos-cm34:2443 -tls1 -cert AS_cert.pem -key 
>AS_priv.key -msg

And it worked fine. This means that your certificate/private key is good.
You can try the command above as well and see that CUCM won't send an alert.

The only remaining unknown is the TLS/SSL library that the application server uses.
Is the application server written in C/C++ or Java? If it's C/C++, can you check which cryptographic library you are using (openssl?). If it's in java, can you please get as many details as possible on the java version and the java security providers. You can get the list of providers by doing:

java.security.Provider [] providers =
java.security.Security.getProviders();

Then iterate through the Providers list, and display:

System.out.println ("Provider [" + i + "] = " + providers[i].toString();

Hi Prem,

as mentioned in one of my last mails, we used an openssl generated certificate and key for the last test.
I attached the generated privatekey to this email.
Here is the command I used to create the certificate: openssl req -new -x509 -days 356 -key mypriv.key -keyout mycert.pem -out mycert.pem -extensions v3_req

In our lab setup, there is no special network configuration. We do not use firewalls in our lab network, just simple routing as our application server and the target CUCM are not in the same network.

Within our application we use a java API for security related things like certificate generation. However, I think we should focus on openssl right now, until we have a fully working certificate at hand that we can use as reference. Then we can try to make appropriate changes in our software so that cert generation in java will result in a working cert as well.

Hello Jens,

Very sorry about the delay. I had hard time getting hold of the engineer.

The engineer looked at the packet capture and could not figure out the exact issue.
What the engineer see is that the CUCM is not happy with one of these 2 encryptions performed by the Application server:

1) the encryption of a pre-master key with the CUCM public key
2) the encryption of one of the handshake messages with the session encryption (symmetric) key.

Engineer was not able to tell which one of the 2 is the problem.
We need to investigate further and maybe involve the openssl Team.

can you please answer the below questions:

- Is there any "special" network configuration in the test set up?
(firewall, NAT, etc.)
- which cryptographic library is are you  using: openssl, java (in this case, which security provider: SUN JCE, RSA, etc)
- can you share with us the private key (we already have the public
key) so that we can troubleshoot further

Thank you,

Hi Prem,

so I generated a new certificate with the discussed options using openssl.
It is still not working, the error remains the same.
Are you sure you know how a working certificate should look like or if secure sip is even working?

Attached you find a new trace, a screenshot from CUCM as well as the certificate.
In the trace, look for communication between 192.168.150.170 (application
server) and 192.168.5.17 (cucm).

Hello Jens,

If you are using java version 7 and the keytool command to generate certificates, it looks like the "certificate sign" attribute can be set.
Check this link:

http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/windows/keytool.html

The option to use is "-ext".

Can you use openssl instead?

Hi Prem,

no news so far. It turns out we use a java API to create the certificate and it is not really easy to find out if this API supports the requested changes and if yes, how to do it.
We are still investigating.

I will inform you, if there is any progress.
