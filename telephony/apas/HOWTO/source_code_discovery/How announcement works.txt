How announcement works?
=======================

How does it work in a nutshell?
-------------------------------
- Announcement media played by RP (route point) before starting recording the call
- First caller or called party calls RP with a consultative call
- Then it changes this call into conference
- And finally originally call will be merged into this conference call and RP starts playing announcement media 



Playing announcemant

Announcement started by JTapi:

	EVENT:	CallCtlTermConnTalkingEv
		--> com.andtek.andphone.recorder.annunciator.CallObserverBase.callChangedEvent(CallEv[] eventList)
			--> com.andtek.andphone.recorder.annunciator.RecordingAnnouncementHandler.onCallCtlTermConnTalking(CallCtlTermConnTalkingEv eev)
				--> internalOnCallCtlTermConnTalking(CallCtlTermConnTalkingEv eev)
					on state: STATE_ANNUNCIATOR_CALL_STARTED
					--> playAnnouncement(CallCtlTermConnTalkingEv eev)
						--> completeConference()
