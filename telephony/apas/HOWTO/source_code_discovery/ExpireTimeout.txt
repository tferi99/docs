=============
ExpireTimeout
=============

- There is a single Timer thread for all call, it will call Expirable.checkExpireable() per seconds.

- An ACD call is represented as ExpireTimeout here and stored into singleton hash in Expirable as ExpirableObject

	private static Hashtable<ExpireableObject, Expireable> expireables = new Hashtable<ExpireableObject, Expireable>();
	
	where 
		key 	: ExpireTimeout
		value	: Expirable - contains ExpireTimeout as data and expire timeout.


Creation
--------
Expire timer created when an ACD call getting routed.

	ACDCall.routed(...)
		--> doRouted(route, call);
		
		when call state changing into STATE_ROUTED_AGENT
		and
			- there is no valid instance and
			- queue has expire time and
			- either there is expired target or found valid override expire target
		
			--> expireTimeout = new ExpireTimeout(this, queue.getExpireTime());
			
			ExpireTimeout will be added to lobal hash of Expirable.
			
				--> Expireable.add(this, timeout);
			
Expire
------
- Expirable.checkExpireable() will be called per secods to find expired entries in Expirable.expirables map.

An entry will be forced to be expired when
	- a call goes into a queue
	OR
	- an ACD call dropped
