DTMF - Dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signaling is used for telephone signaling over the line in the voice-frequency band to the call switching center. 

PSTN - public switched telephone network
	Is the world's collection of interconnected voice-oriented public telephone networks, both commercial and government-owned. It's also referred to as the Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS). 
	It's the aggregation of circuit-switching telephone networks that has evolved from the days of Alexander Graham Bell. 
	Today, it is almost entirely digital in technology except for the final link from the central (local) telephone office to the user.

SDP - Session Description Protocol (SDP)

	parameters between the user agents. Media details, transport addresses, and other
	media-related information are exchanged between the user agents using the SDP protocol.

SPAN/Port Mirroring - Port Mirroring is used on a network switch to send a copy of network packets seen on one switch port (or an entire VLAN) to a network monitoring connection on another switch port. 
	This is commonly used for network appliances that require monitoring of network traffic, such as an intrusion-detection system. Port mirroring on a Cisco Systems switch is generally 
	referred to as Switched Port Analyzer (SPAN).
