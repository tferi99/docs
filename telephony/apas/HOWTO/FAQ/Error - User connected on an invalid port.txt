Error - User connected on an invalid port
=========================================
APAS:
	Primary CTI Manager: Connection to CTI Manager (192.168.150.17) was unsuccessful.
	Exception: Unable to create provider -- User connected on an invalid port

Log:
	com.cisco.jtapi.PlatformExceptionImpl: Unable to create provider -- User connected on an invalid port


If you have this error during startup or testing CUCM connection (APAS/Global/Configuration CUCM/[CUCM CTI MAnager]/(Test connection))
the problem is your application user is member of Standard CTI Secure Connection.

Adding the user to the Secure CTI and SRTP Key Material groups means that this JTAPI user will ONLY be allowed to connect on the secure 
port of 2749 using certs. To connected on a non secure port later, remove the user from these secure groups.
