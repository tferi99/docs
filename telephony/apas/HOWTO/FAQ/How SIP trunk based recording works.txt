Basics
======
- In IP phone-based call recording, recording streams are forked from an agent IP phone to the recorder.
- It forks both 
	- NEAREND (it's own) and
	- FAREND (not-recorded) streams 
	and sends to recorder.
- The agent voice and the customer voice are sent separately.
- The administrator configures the recorder in Cisco Unified Communications Manager as a SIP trunk device.
- The administrator configures the recording option and recording profile on the agent line appearance. 
	By default, the recording option specifies Call Recording Disabled.
- When the recording option is set to either Automatic Call Recording Enabled or Selective Call Recording
	Enabled, the line appearance can be associated with a recording profile. 
- The recording profile specifies the following parameters: 
	- Recording Calling Search Space
	- Recording Destination Address.

- NEAR end:	which recorded (agent)
- FAR end: other endpoint (customer - calling/called party)

APAS recording implementation
=============================
In theory recorder is application which connected to CUCM with SIP trunk. It gets control messages via SIP trunk 
and it receives RTP packages from streams.

In APAS recording implemented in 2 separated processes because of performance considerations.
APAS implemented as a Java WEB application, it cannot perform high-performance data processing. 

In APAS recording splitted up 2 separated processes:
	1. APAS 
		It receives control messages from SIP trunk and connected to streams, but it doesn't read stream data itself.
		It sends control messages to separated recorder process.
		
	2. Recorder process implemented in C. It commnicates with APAS with XML messages. It is not connected to stream 
		(APAS has stream endpoints) but it gets RTP (UDP) packets with sniffing the network traffic.

SIP details
===========
- Release 8.5(1) of Cisco Unified Communications Manager introduces enhancements to the SIP headers that
	are used in the SIP messages that are sent to the recorder when call recording calls are made.
	(Open Recording Architecture (ORA) Cisco MediaSense recorder)
		
Cisco MediaSense recorder.
- Cisco Unified Communications Manager sends both the agent (near-end) and customer (far-end) call
	information to the recorder via SIP messages. Messages travel through the SIP trunk.	
	(Prior to this only near-end)
	
- The From header contains the near-end call info. The near-end call information contains refci or the call ID
of the near-end party, near-end device name, near-end directory number or address.

- With the SIP header enhancement, the far-end call information gets added to the INVITE message From
header. The far-end call information contains farend refci or the call ID of the far-end party, far-end device
name, and far-end directory number.

- Previously, Cisco Unified Communications Manager only sent a SIP INVITE message to a recorder. Now,
when the far-end call info changes due to feature interaction, Cisco Unified Communications Manager sends
a SIP UPDATE message to the recorder.

- The From header also includes an isfocus indicator, which indicates that an agent is in a conference call.
Examples of the previous INVITE message and the new INVITE and UPDATE messages follow.
		
- Be aware that the two INVITE messages for the two separate voice streams contain the same near-end and
far-end call information. The only difference in the two From headers is the first x- parameter, which indicates
whether the call is for the near-end voice stream or for the far-end voice stream.
