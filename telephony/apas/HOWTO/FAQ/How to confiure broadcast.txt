How to confiure broadcast?
==========================
Broadcast types:
	- text
	- media
		- live
		- uploaded

		Depends on setting: 	APAS/Broadcast/Group List/(Media)
	
	
You can call:
	- with XML service:		http://192.168.5.113:8080/andphone/MCastService?group=<ID>&dev=#DEVICENAME#&silent=false
	
	- or by calling Rout Point DN configured in:	APAS/Broadcast/Group List/(Media)
	
	
	
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Configuration
=============
- Add Broadcast Group 	

	APAS/Broadcast/Group List
	

- If you want to call Broadcasting via RoutePoint add a RP in:

	APAS/Broadcast/Configuration/[Broadcast Configuration]/(Route Point)
	
	If you assign a line to RP, calling with this DN you can start broadcasting.

	- Specify RP line DN in 
	
		APAS/Broadcast/Group List/<group>/[Group Parameter]/(RP-DN)
		
		
- Set media type in:
			
	APAS/Broadcast/Group List/<group>/[Group Parameter]/(Media)
	
	- None (text-only):  text broadcast
	- IP Phone Live Broadcast: by pressing and holding down push button (rendered into broadcast popup of initiator and targets) you can send voice messages (like WalkyTalky)
	- you can choose uploaded media: it will be played as broadcast stream

	Talk button:
		If you want talk button (for IP Phone Live Broadcast) specify it in 
		
			APAS/Broadcast/Group List/<group>/[Group Parameter]/(Talk Button)
			
			
- Target phones can call back initiator if 'Pickup' button rendered on popop if:

	- broadcast started by calling RP
	- talk button is specified (so NOT: 'No Talk button'
	- Media is NOT 'IP Phone Live Broadcast'
	
	
- Add messages and answers

- Assign memebers and specify who can be initiator and terminator
