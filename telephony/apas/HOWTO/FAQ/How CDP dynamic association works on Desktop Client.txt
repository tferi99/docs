How CDP dynamic association works on Desktop Client?
====================================================

NOTE: 
	CDP is depretcated since not supported WinPCAP library. WinPCAP not supported sence several years and works unstable nowadays.

Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP)
------------------------------
CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol) is a Cisco proprietary protocol that runs between direct connected network entities (routers, switches, remote access devices, IP telephones etc.). 
The purpose of the protocol is to supply a network entity with information about its direct connected neighbors.

CDP multicast messages will be sent by devices per 60 seconds.

How it works in DC?
===================
- CDP enabled in phones

- DC PC connected to network via phne device which will be associated

- disable 'Span to PC Port' on phone device, otherwise CDP packages from every phone will be forwarded to your PC and DC will sniff them 
	and generated bad 'cdp' messages to ASAS
	
- DC sniffs for CDP packages and if no phone associated to DC it will send 'cdp' and 'associatePhone' messages to APAS

- APAS wil associate phone temporarly (in memory) where timestamp is 120 secs

	If cleanup called on APAS it will remove old entries. Cleanup only called on terminal change. 
	If phone inactivated and activated again CDP will activate is again.
