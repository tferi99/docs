Configuration of public folders
================================
- Pre-requisities:
	- Create a domain user and add to Domain Admins group in Active Directory.

		- AD/Active Directory Users and Computers
			- choose a folder
			- right-mouse/New/User
			- In user properties 'Member of...'

		!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IMPORTANT NOTE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
		Don't use Administrator for development purposes. It has a lot of permissions by default but sometimes it has limitations for security reasons
		(e.g. it cannot use for mailing and that's the reasonif you want to use it for accessing Public Folders).
		-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		
	- Create a mailbox for new user in Exchange.

		- Exchange admin center/recipients/mailboxes
			- +/User mailbox
			- browse users
		

- Exchange
	- Create Public folder mailbox
	
		- Exchange admin center/public folders/public folder mailboxes
			- +
			- select OU
			- select mailbox database
		
		
	- Create Public Folders. Add multiple folders if you need it.
		
		- Exchange admin center/public folders/public folders
	
		
		
	- Add permission.
	
		EITHER add for all folders in a single step:
		
			- Exchange admin center/public folders/public folders
	
		OR set permissions on folder one-by-one
		
		
		TIP:
		
			Check permissions with cmdlet. Call 'Exchange Management Shell' on Exchange server (it's a special PowerShell) and run:
			
				Get-PublicFolder -Recurse | Get-PublicFolderClientPermission | Select-Object Identity,User,AccessRights,IsValid
				
					Identity User       AccessRights IsValid
					-------- ----       ------------ -------
					\        Default    {Author}        True
					\        Anonymous  {None}          True
					\        Apas Admin {Owner}         True
					\users   Default    {Author}        True
					\users   Anonymous  {None}          True
					\users   Apas Admin {Owner}         True
					
	- Enable mailing for folders
	
		Select a folder and set mailing on the right panel (Mail settings - Enabled/Disabled)
		
		
	

- APAS/Directory/Directories/
	- (Add)
	- Exchange SOAP Contacts
	
	
	- SOAP Service URL - format: 	https://<EXCHANGE_SERVER>/EWS/Exchange.asmx
	- Login: User account is used for Exchange SOAP authentication. Format: user@domain
	- Folder name:
		- contactsroot: with this name APAS will get content of all public folders under root public folder recursively

		
- Command line solution		
	You can do the same actions in CLI.
	
	Don't use simple PowerShell but Exchange Management Shell (special PowerShell).
	Here are some usable commmands:
	
		New-Mailbox –PublicFolder –Name 'TestPFMB' –Database 'Mailbox Database 0917630365'

		Get-OrganizationConfig | Select *public*
		Get-Mailbox –PublicFolder | FL Name, ExchangeGuid

		Get-OrganizationConfig | Format-List RootPublicFolderMailbox

		Get-mailbox –PublicFolder 'DevPFMB' | fl Name, SamAccountName, IsShared, ExchangeUserAccountControl, RecipientTypeDetails

		<manually created 'Exchange Team' before
		New-PublicFolder "Migration" –path '\Exchange Team'
		New-PublicFolder "Network Team" –Mailbox 'TestPFMB'

		Get-PublicFolder -Recurse
		Get-Mailbox –PublicFolder | Get-MailboxStatics | Select DisplayName, TotalItemSize

		$Perms = Get-ManagementRole -Cmdlet Get-MailboxStatics 
		$Perms | foreach {Get-ManagementRoleAssignment -Role $_.Name -Delegating $false | Format-Table -Auto Role,RoleAssigneeType,RoleAssigneeName}

		Get-PublicFolder -Identity "\Exchange Team" | FL
		Get-PublicFolder -Identity "\Exchange Team\Migration" | FL

		Get-OrganizationConfig  | fl *public*
		Get-PublicFolder -Recurse | Get-PublicFolderClientPermission | Select-Object Identity,User,AccessRights,IsValid
		Get-PublicFolderStatistics

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Add contacts to public folders
==============================
Pre-requisities:	configured Outlook desktop application configured with user who is an Owner of public folders.

NOTE:	
You need a domain user for Outlook and it important to login with the same user into Windows (with the same domain).
That means you Windows also should be this domain.

- Create new public folder in root public folder or in existig one. 

	Folder contains: Contact Items

- Go to this folder and add new contacts into it.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Private folders	
===============
- configure impersonation for account user

	SEE: Exchange - How to set impersonation rights manually.pdf
	
- You can create also private folders in Outlook (folders not 'contacts').
- type of folder should be: 'Contact items'

- 2 modes:

	- contacts only:								folder name is 'contacts'
	- contacts and subdirectories recursively:		folder name is 'contactsroot'

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Howto enable basic authentication in Exchange Server?
=====================================================
- Go to 'Exchange admin center'
- servers/virtual directories

- choose Autodiscover/(Edit)/authentication
	- SET 'Integrated Windows authentication'
	- SET 'Digest...'
	- REMOVE 'Basic authentication'
	- Save
- choose 'EWS'/(Edit)/authentication
	- SET 'Integrated Windows authentication'
	- SET 'Digest...'
	- SET 'Basic authentication'
	- Save


- If it's cannot work remove 'Integrated' and 'Digest' but use this settings ONLY temporarily,
	other services maybe cannot work (e.g. Outlook clients, server connections)
	
	Sometimes I found that 'Integrated Windows authentication' can be priority over 'Basic authentication' is enabled.
	
	IMPORTANT: Use this setting is ONLY FOR developer test of this feature. It maybe can harm other functions (Outlook, other server connections).

Troubleshooting
===============
Error 401:

	If you have the following error during connecting to Exchange Server:

	[2020-04-16 15:38:13,017] [WARN] [APAS-TimerDaemon] [Modules.java:807] - Modules: Slow background dispatch time of 1034ms for recorder
	[2020-04-16 15:38:18,235] [ERROR] [http-nio-8080-exec-8] [ExchangeSoapServiceImpl.java:514] - EXCHANGE_SOAP: Exception

	Current implementation only supports Basic Authentication, maybe Basic Authentication not enabled on Exchange Server.

Outlook cannot login:	which connected before - a login dialog displayed

	In the same page where you configure Basic Auhtntication check if these options are set:
	- Integrated Windows uthentication 
	- (and maybe) Digest Authentication for Windows domain server
