Configuration of public folders
================================
- Pre-requisities:
	- Create a domain user and add to Domain Admins group in Active Directory.

		- AD/Active Directory Users and Computers
			- choose a folder
			- right-mouse/New/User
			- In user properties 'Member of...'

		!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IMPORTANT NOTE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
		Don't use Administrator for development purposes. It has a lot of permissions by default but sometimes it has limitations for security reasons
		(e.g. it cannot use for mailing and that's the reasonif you want to use it for accessing Public Folders).
		-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		
	- Create a mailbox for new user in Exchange.

		- Exchange admin center/recipients/mailboxes
			- +/User mailbox
			- browse users
		

- Exchange
	- Create Public folder mailbox
	
		- Exchange admin center/public folders/public folder mailboxes
			- +
			- select OU
			- select mailbox database
		
		
	- Create Public Folders. Add multiple folders if you need it.
		
		- Exchange admin center/public folders/public folders
	
		
		
	- Add permission.
	
		EITHER add for all folders in a single step:
		
			- Exchange admin center/public folders/public folders
	
		OR set permissions on folder one-by-one
		
		
		TIP:
		
			Check permissions with cmdlet. Call 'Exchange Management Shell' on Exchange server (it's a special PowerShell) and run:
			
				Get-PublicFolder -Recurse | Get-PublicFolderClientPermission | Select-Object Identity,User,AccessRights,IsValid
				
					Identity User       AccessRights IsValid
					-------- ----       ------------ -------
					\        Default    {Author}        True
					\        Anonymous  {None}          True
					\        Apas Admin {Owner}         True
					\users   Default    {Author}        True
					\users   Anonymous  {None}          True
					\users   Apas Admin {Owner}         True
					
	- Enable mailing for folders
