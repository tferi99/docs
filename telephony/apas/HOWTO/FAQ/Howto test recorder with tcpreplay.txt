Howto test recorder with tcpreplay?
===================================

Customer often send PCAP file whish can help us to reproduce problems
if you replay it to your local recorder.

You can replay PCAP with tcpreplay. It's part of a package, which you can download from here:	http://tcpreplay.synfin.net/
You have to build it from source code.

tcpreplay - replays pcap files at arbitrary speeds onto the network

	tcpreplay -t -i <interface>


Only question how to trigger recorder to capture RTP streams?
It depends of the type of recording.
	
SPAN H.323
----------
In this mode recorder will get control information from PCAP.
You just have to add recording rule which likely matches to recorded calls.
E.g. you can specify a global regex rule (.*).

Then somply play PCAP file and calls will be recorded again.

SIP Trunk
=========	
Here call information comes from JTAPI and from SIP.
To trigger calls here you have to identify call paramaters from logs (call ID, source/destination port of RTP stream)
(from andphone.log, sip_protocol.log)
and you have to send recordCall XML messages to recorder which can be retrieved from andphone_record.log

You just have to add recording rule which matches to recorded calls.

e.g:

	<recordCall terminal="SEP00258418F4DD" callID="sip36366/1" callingParty="4922429236514333" 
	calledParty="4922429236513377" callingPartyName="ICS-UA" calledPartyName="" originalCallingParty="4922429236514333" 
	originalCalledParty="4922429236513377" lastRedirectingParty="" initiated="false"/> 

	<recordCall terminal="SEP00258418F4DD" callID="sip36366/1" srcIP="10.10.0.83" srcPort="45305"/> 

	<recordCall terminal="SEP00258418F4DD" callID="sip36366/1" dstIP="10.10.0.83" dstPort="42111"/> 

	tcpreplay -t -i eth0
	
	<recordCall terminal="SEP00258418F4DD" callID="sip36366/1" stopOut="1" />
