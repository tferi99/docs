Howto build recorder?
=====================

1. Checkout SVN (http://devel.andtek.com/svn/andphone_record/trunk/src/andphone_record) to your developer environment.

2. SSH to server Jenkins SLAVE server (192.168.150.14) and mount your source directory:

	To mount your local recorder source:
		- add REMOTE tunneling:		R 50445:localhost:445
		- add mount entry to /etc/fstab:
		
			//127.0.0.1/andphone_record_remote /mnt/ftoth/dev/andphone_record cifs user,uid=500,rw,suid,port=50445,username=ftoth,noauto 0 0
			
			where 500 is your UID

		- OR open INCOMING ports 139 and 445 
		
			mount -t cifs -o ftoth //192.168.5.113/andphone_record andphone_record_remote
			
			
		- create mount directory if missing 
		- mount /mnt/ftoth/andphone_record
		
		NOTE:
			Pre-requisty here installed samba client package (samba-client).
		
2. Build project

	- go to project directory (/mnt/ftoth/andphone_record)

	- ant

		It calls 'cmake'
		
			cmake
				-> CMakeLists.txt
					-> find_package()
						It find packages. CMake searches for a file called "Find<package>.cmake" in the CMAKE_MODULE_PATH followed by the CMake installation. 
						If the file is found, it is read and processed by CMake. 
						It is responsible for finding the package, checking the version, and producing any needed messages. 
						
						(Here CMAKE_MODULE_PATH:	 ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake)

						
			
3. Artifact generated into 'build' directory.

			

NOTE:
	If you move project into another directory delete PROJECT_DIR/build and call ant again. 
	It will re-generate makefiles (cmake).
