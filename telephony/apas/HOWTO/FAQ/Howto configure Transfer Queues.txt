Howto configure Transfer Queues?
================================
Transfer Queues:
	If you transfer a call by Desktop Client and destination is busy, APAS queues the caller until destination is available.

Steps:

- Create a RoutePoint (TOTH_RP_COMM) for desktop client.

- Assign this RP to client configuration:

	APAS/Client/Configuration		[Desktop Configuration]/Route Point
		
- Create a transfer queue in APAS:	APAS/Group/Queue List
	- Set 'Call Distribution' to 'Queued Transfer'
	- Don't add any agents
	- Specify 'Expire time' if you need expiration for queued transfers
	
- Create a pilot and assign transfer queue 	
	For pilot number you have to add a new line to ACD Route Point.
	
	To get name of ACD RP go to: APAS/Group/Settings/[ACD Options]/Route Point name

- Create/edit a client profile
	Assign transfer pilot (assigned with transfer queue) to this profile (Queue Transfer Pilot combo).
