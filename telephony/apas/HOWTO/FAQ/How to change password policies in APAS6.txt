How to change password policies in APAS6?
=========================================
Edit

	/etc/security/pwquality.conf
	
	
e.g. set 

	minlen = 1
	
	
NOTE:
		
	Maybe after setting a weak policy you still have this warning:
	
		BAD PASSWORD: The password is a palindrome
		
	but it can be ignored.
