How to configure JTAPI presence?
================================

1. Static presence using observe pools
--------------------------------------

- Create extension pool for participants:

	- APAS/General/Pools
	
	- Add (Extensions)
		- Assign devices to pool
	

- Assign this pool to a desktop client profile as observe pool.

	APAS/Client/Profiles/[Observe Pools]/(Observe Pool)

- Restart APAS to start presence observers.	
	
Test, troubleshooting
---------------------
NOTE: 

	For testing presence-ONLY remove participant DNs from other groups because group feature also 
	provides presence information.

- Open JTAPI debug page
	
	Assigned terminals and lines should have registered com.andtek.andphone.ccm.jtapi.LineObserver .
	
- Start DC

- Add Group widget.
	
	Normal group will be displayed if you have installed.
	
- Right click on header of Group widget
	- Add new tab
	- Right click on new tab
		- Edit tab
		- Choose 'BLF' from list
		- Drag and Drop items from list on the right side into new tab.
	
NOTE: 
	This list contains DNs which either are part of observe pool assigned to current client profile or 
	are member any group. So again - if you want to make a pure test on observe pool remove pool members
	from ggroups.
	
	
2. Dynamic JTAPI presence via directory search
----------------------------------------------

- Create a directory for search where it contains an attribute which type is 'Presence DN'.

	Presence DN will identify device which will be observed for presence.
 
- Create a directory group and assign directory created before.

- Go to 

	APAS/Client/Profiles/EDIT/[Directory Search]
	
	and choose a 'Directoy Group' and set 'Enable Dynamic JTAPI Presence'
	
- Call DC and add a Directory widget.

- When you call a search observers will be created on terminals contained by search result on demand:

	com.andtek.andphone.ccm.jtapi.presence.DynamicJtapiPresenceObserver 
	
	These observers are live temporarly. You can configure life-time of observers here:
	
		APAS/Client/Configuration/[Presence Subscription Time]
		
	in seconds. 
	
	Note here: observer cleanup logic polling time is about 1 minute.
	
Test, troubleshooting
---------------------
- Configured Dynamic JTAPI presence
- Call a search from DC
	- Call JTAPI Debug page and seach 'DynamicJtapiPresenceObserver'
	
	Terminals from search result where result item contains attribute with 'Presence DN' type should have 
	
		com.andtek.andphone.ccm.jtapi.presence.DynamicJtapiPresenceObserver 
		
		
	NOTE: 
		If line is member of an observe pool DynamicJtapiPresenceObserver won't be created.
		
		
- After starting search these observers should be destroyed after 'Presence Subscription Time' seconds.

- To show dynamic subscriptions use 'Dynamic JTAPI Presence Subscriptions' page:
