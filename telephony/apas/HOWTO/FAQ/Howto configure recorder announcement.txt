Howto configure recorder announcement?
======================================

Recording announcements are used to play a media file at the beginning of a voice call.

How does it work?
-----------------
- Announcement media played by RP (route point) before starting recording the call
- First caller or called party calls RP with a consultative call
- Then it changes this call into conference
- And finally originally call will be merged into this conference call and RP starts playing announcement media

How to configure?
-----------------
- Add a media in APAS/Global/Media

- Configure recording RP in APAS

- Add a 2nd line to RP

- Configure announcement in:	APAS/Recording/Configuration/[Recorder Announcement Parameters]
	- Add media
	- Specify RP line DN (configured above)
	
- Set announcement in recording rule parameters (set 'play announcement' flag)	
	
- Configure conference service on CUCM
	
Troubleshooting
---------------
- Call RP DN directly - media should be played 

- Make a recording with rule where 'play announcement' flag is true.
	- All participants should be in conference call during playing announcement
