==================================
Busy signal when you call a device	
==================================
Possible reasons:
	- Device is not in your domain.
		Fix: Add device to your application user.
		
	- Device is a Route Point but conversation codec is not supported by Route Point.
		Fix: Add codec to capabilities during registration. E.g.:
		
					// registering terminal
					CiscoRouteTerminal term = (CiscoRouteTerminal) t;
					CiscoMediaCapability[] cap = { 
						new CiscoG711MediaCapability(), 
						new CiscoG729MediaCapability()
					};		
					term.register(cap, CiscoRouteTerminal.DYNAMIC_MEDIA_REGISTRATION);
