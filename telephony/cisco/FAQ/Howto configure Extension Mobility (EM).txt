Howto configure Extension Mobility (EM)?
========================================
NOTE here: in some environment End users are replicated from extenal source (e.g. Active directory) 

1. Create End User

2. Enable EM in device:

	CUCM/Device/Phone/[Extension Information]/Enable Extension Mobility
	
	Logout profile: --- User current device settings ---

3. Create a device profile
	- CUCM/Device/Device Settings/Device profile/'Add new'
	
	- Choose 'Phone Button Template' for target device
			[User Device Profile Information]/Phone Button Template
			
	- Add line(s) to that profile
	
	- Assign logged out end-user profile (device go back here after logout) or set <None> if you want device defaults:
	
		[Logged Out (Default) Profile Information]/Login User Id		
	
4. Assign device profile(s) to end user
	- In /User Management/End User/[Extension Mobility] 
	
		drop entry/enties from 'Available Profiles' to 'Controlled Profiles'.
		
	- You can choose default profile if you want (if you have multiple controlled profiles)
	
5. Add XML service to phone menu where you want to log in using this profile.
	
	http://CUCM:8080/emapp/EMAppServlet?device=#DEVICENAME#
	
6. Calling this service you have to specify:
	
		end user name (only first time)
		password
		
	After login assigned profile will be loaded into device and user settings/lines will overwrite default profile of device.

7. Add XML service to phone menu of EM device where you want to logout:
	
	http://CUCM:8080/emapp/EMAppServlet?device=#DEVICENAME#

	- check current profile:
		- go to:	CUCM/Device/Phone/[Extension Information]
		- state of device in:
			- Current End User Profile
