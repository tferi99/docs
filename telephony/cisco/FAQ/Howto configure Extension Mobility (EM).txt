2. Enable EM in device:

	CUCM/Device/Phone/[Extension Information]/Enable Extension Mobility

3. Create a device profile
	- CUCM/Device/Device Settings/Device profile/'Add new'
	
	- Choose 'Phone Button Template' for target device
			[User Device Profile Information]/Phone Button Template
			
	- Add line(s) to that profile
	
	- Assign end user:
	
		[Logged Out (Default) Profile Information]/Login User Id		
	
4. Assign device profile(s) to end user
	- In /UserManagement/End User/[Extension Mobility] drop entry/enties from 'Available Profiles' to 'Controlled Profiles'.
	- You can choose default profile if you want (if you have multiple controlled profiles)
	
5. Add XML service to phone menu where you want to log in using this profile.
	
	http://192.168.5.18:8080/emapp/EMAppServlet?device=#DEVICENAME#
	
6. Calling this service you have to specify:
	
		end user name (only first time)
		password
		
	After login assigned profile will be loaded into device and user settings/lines will overwrite default profile of device.
