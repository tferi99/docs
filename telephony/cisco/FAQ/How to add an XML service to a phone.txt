How to add an XML service to a phone?
=====================================
Enterprise level setting:	System/Enterprise parameters/Phone URL Parameters/URL Services field

Device level setting:	Phone Configuration page/External Data Locations Information/Services field

Service configuration:	Device/Device Settings/Phone services
			
			- add new service
			- set enterprise to false
			- enable it
			- go to a device
			- choose 'Subscribe/Unsubscribe services' from related links combo (top-right)

NOTE: sometimes you have to set service provisioning if service menu doesn't work (Phone Configuration page/Device Information/Services Provisioning combo)
	Settings 'Both' will work with all phone models.
