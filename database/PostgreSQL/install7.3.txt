Postgres 7.3.1 installation
===========================

Server installation from source
===============================

=====
Linux
=====
Requirements:
	C compiler
	Libs: readline, zlib

Installation:
	extract postgresql-docs-7.3.1.tar.gz		(e.g. in /usr/source)
	./configure		(or ./configure --prefix=<install_destdir>, where destdir for example: /usr/local/pgsql73 )
	make
	su
	make install
	adduser postgres	(if Linux user not created yet)
	mkdir /usr/local/pgsql73/data
	chown postgres /usr/local/pgsql73/data
	su - postgres
		
Starting:
	/usr/local/pgsql73/bin/postmaster -D /usr/local/pgsql73/data >logfile 2>&1 &
Testing:
	/usr/local/pgsql73/bin/createdb test
	/usr/local/pgsql73/bin/psql test

(see more in INSTALL)




======
Cygwin
======
1. Install cygwin (1.3.16)
2. Install cygipc - if it isn't contained by cygwin (exctract in / in cygwin)
3. Extract postgresql-7.3.2 in /usr/src
4. Go to postgresql-7.3.2 directory
5. Call ./configure 		(or ./configure --prefix=<install_destdir>)
   NOTE:
	Before calling it maybe you have to add libcygipc.a to library list, or 
	copy it from /usr/local/lib into /lib



6. make
7. make install

8. Initializing database:
	ipc-daemon &			(or Cygserver)
	/usr/local/pgsql/bin/initdb -D /usr/local/pgsql/data

   'ipc-daemon' is necessary for PostgreSQL.
	NOTE: Newer versions of Cygwin provide IPC functions 
              by cygserver (see above).
   'initdb' creates /usr/local/pgsql/data directory for database.

NOTE:
	Maybe you have to add these directories to PATH:
		/usr/local/pgsql/bin
		/usr/local/pgsql/lib

Testing:

First start ipc-domain (if it isn't running) and postmaster (lisk to postgres) with '-i' parameter.
It starts engine with TCP/IP listener.

Starting engine:
	ipc-daemon &			(or Cygserver)
	postmaster -i &

Create a database:
	createdb testdb

SQL client:
	psql testdb

If you would like to connect to the database from an external host, you have to add a host entry to 
/usr/local/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf, for example:

host        all     192.168.0.113   255.255.255.0   trust


=====================
Cygwin with cygserver
=====================
Newer versions of Cygwin provide IPC functions by cygserver (see above).

At the first call initalize Cyserver:

	cygserver-config

This can install Cyserver as service. Start Cyserver before starting Postgres.

The Cygserver services are used by Cygwin applications only if you set the environment
variable CYGWIN to contain the string "server". You must do this before
starting the application.

	export CYGWIN=server



JAVA clients
============
There are 2 JDBC package:

	pgjdbc1.jar	: for JAVA1
	pgjdbc2.jar	: for JAVA2

You can get these drivers by building postgres with java option:

	$> ./configure --with-java

,or simpy download drinvers from Internet.


Name of driver class:

	org.postgresql.Driver

URL for connection one of the followings:

	jdbc:postgresql:database
	jdbc:postgresql://host/database
	jdbc:postgresql://host:port/database

NOTE:
	You don't have to install additional PosgreSQL client before using JDBC drivers, because these are
	'thin' drivers.

See more: posgres_jdbc.html



Troubleshooting
---------------
If you get this error message during make (mainly in Cygwin):

	libpq/SUBSYS.o(.text+0x201b):crypt.c: undefined reference to `_crypt'

than you have to install crypt package and run installation from start 
(so call also 'configure' again).
