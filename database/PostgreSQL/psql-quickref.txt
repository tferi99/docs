More important command line parameters:
-A 			: not aligned output mode

-c [query]		: query to execute

-d [dbname]		: database to connect (equivalent to databse parameter)

-e			: echo queries 

-f [filename]		: input file for commands -> non interactive mode
			  if filename is '-' (hyphen), commands are expecting
			  from standard input

			  If  host  begins  with a slash, it is used as the  
			  directory  for  the  unix domain socket.

-l 			: list databases

-o [filename]		: query results go into this file 

-p [port]		: TCP/IP port of database host. If not specified, it

-q			: quiet mode, welcome message or somethings are 
			  supressed.

-s			: single step mode

-t			: titles and row indexes are supressed in query output.
