Shorewall 3.x kick start
========================

1. Checking iproute/iproute2 has been installed:

	# winch ip
	/sbin/ip

2. Installing from rpm.

3. Creating zones by editing /etc/shorewall/zones. For example:


	#ZONE   TYPE        OPTIONS     IN          OUT
	#                   OPTIONS         OPTIONS
	fw  firewall
	net ipv4
	loc ipv4
	#LAST LINE - ADD YOUR ENTRIES ABOVE THIS ONE - DO NOT REMOVE


There entries creates 3 zones:
	fw	: for firewall (myself)
	net	: internet
	loc	: local LAN

4. Creating default behavior of packages by creating policies:

	#SOURCE     DEST        POLICY      LOG     LIMIT:BURST
	#                       LEVEL
	net         all         DROP        info
	loc         net         ACCEPT
	all         all         REJECT      info
	#LAST LINE -- DO NOT REMOVE

For each connection request entering the firewall, the request is first checked against the 
/etc/shorewall/rules file. If no rule in that file matches the connection request then the 
first policy in /etc/shorewall/policy that matches the request is applied after the request 
is passed to the appropriate common action (if any).

Policies prescribe connection level behavior. Shorewall is built on top of the Netfilter kernel facility. 
Netfilter implements a connection tracking function that allows what is often referred to as stateful 
inspection of packets. This stateful property allows firewall rules to be defined in terms of CONNECTIONS 
rather than in terms of PACKETS. 

These entries do the followings:
	- allow all connection requests from your local network to the internet

	- drop (ignore) all connection requests from the internet to your firewall or local network and log a message 
	  at the info level (here is a description of log levels).

	- reject all other connection requests and log a message at the info level. When a request 
	  is rejected, the firewall will return an RST (if the protocol is TCP) or an ICMP 
	  port-unreachable packet for other protocols.


5. To assign zones with physical interfaces edit /etc/shorewall/interfaces file:

	#ZONE   INTERFACE   BROADCAST   OPTIONS
	net     eth0        detect      norfc1918
	loc     eth1        detect
	#LAST LINE -- ADD YOUR ENTRIES BEFORE THIS ONE -- DO NOT REMOVE

	
	That means eth0 is interface to the internet, and eth1 is to local network.

	'norfc1918' option provides anti spoofing funcionality (it drops every packets whiach are non-routable among public 
	Internet machines - see RFC 1918):

		10.0.0.0    - 10.255.255.255
		172.16.0.0  - 172.31.255.255
		192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255



6. If your frirewall is a router, set IP_FORWARDING=On in /etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf .

7. For internal machines with RFC 1918 addresses from which you want to access Internet you 
   can specify SNAT or dinamic NAT (Masquarading).


   SNAT is configured in Shorewall using the /etc/shorewall/masq file:

	#INTERFACE     SUBNET               ADDRESS
	eth0           192.168.201.0/29     192.0.2.176

8. DNAT provides a way to allow connections from the internet to internal servers.

Suppose that your daughter wants to run a web server on her system “Local 3”. 
You could allow connections to the internet to her server by adding the following 
entry in /etc/shorewall/rules:

	#ACTION  SOURCE  DEST               PROTO  DEST    SOURCE    ORIGINAL
	#                                          PORT(S) PORT(S)   DEST
	DNAT     net     loc:192.168.201.4  tcp    www


9. Add rules to extend default policies.

   For example enabling SSH from internet to firewall (/etc/shorewall/rules):

	#ACTION  SOURCE          DEST               PROTO  DEST		COMMENTS 
	#                                           PORT(S)
	ACCEPT   loc             dmz                tcp    ssh		#SSH to the DMZ
	ACCEPT   net             $FW                tcp    ssh		#SSH to the
							  		#Firewall


10. Check files:

	shorewall check


11. Start anf try

	shorewall start

12. Another safe way to try your configuration:

	- there is a working configuration
	- copy into another directory
	- 


Usable tools
------------
Calculating network subnet addresses:

	ipcalc { <address>/<vlsm> | <address> <netmask> }


	For example:

	vmw:/etc/shorewall # shorewall ipcalc 192.168.0.234/24
	   WARNING: Shorewall startup is disabled. To enable startup, set STARTUP_ENABLED=Yes in /etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf
	   CIDR=192.168.0.234/24
	   NETMASK=255.255.255.0
	   NETWORK=192.168.0.0
	   BROADCAST=192.168.0.255

Information queries:

	shorewall show connections		(same as 'cat /proc/net/ip_conntrack')
