About devices
=============
Devices can access as files in /dev. Each device file has a major and minor 
number.

major number	: identifies the device driver referenced by this file.
				  So every device file handled by the same device driver have 
				  the same major number.
minor number	: all physical devices controlled by the same device driver
				  (so given them the same major number) are distinguished by 
				  different minor numbers.
