Redirection in shell
====================

- Redirections are processed in order they appear, from left to right.
For example:

	ls > dirlist 2>&1
	
directs both standard output and standard error to the file 'dirlist', while the command

	ls 2>&1 > dirlist

directs only standard output to file 'dirlist', because the standard error was duplicated as standard output before the standard output was redirected to dirlist.
