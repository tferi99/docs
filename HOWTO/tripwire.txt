
Installing, using Tripwire
==========================
Tripwire is a file integrity check and intrusion detection tool. This 
mini-howto based on version 2.2.1 .

1. Extract install package from .tgz file, and call install.sh
Note:
	On SuSE you have to TWEDITOR in install.cfg to /usr/bin/vibefore calling
	install.sh .

2. During installation specify keyphrases used for protecting key files.

3. Create policy file from policy source (e.g. there is a sample source for
   SuSE: suse.txt . Maybe you have to change it, because not all listed file 
   has been installed on your system). For example:

   twadmin --create-polfile suse.txt
or   
   twadmin -m P suse.txt
	
4. Initialize Tripwire database:

	tripwire --init
or
	tripwire -m i

It will use policy file generated during step 3.

5. Some command:

	Checking integrity:

		tripwire --check
	or	
		tripwire -m c
