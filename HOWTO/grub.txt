Booting with grub
=================

Grub is Grand Unified Boot Loader.

Creating GRUB boot floppy
-------------------------

	mke2fs /dev/fd0
	mount /dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy
	mkdir /mnt/floppy/boot
	mkdir /mnt/floppy/boot/grub
	cp /usr/share/grub/i386-pc/stage1 /mnt/floppy/boot/grub
	cp /usr/share/grub/i386-pc/stage2 /mnt/floppy/boot/grub

	Run grub, and in grub prompt:

	grub> root (fd0)
	grub> setup (fd0)
	grub> quit

This will boot a GRUB shell from floppy. 

'stage1', 'stage2' files are boot images. The first "root" command told 
GRUB where to look for its auxiliary files (stage1 and stage2). By default, 
GRUB looks in the /boot/grub directory on the partition or disk you specify.
Next, we typed the 'setup' command, which told GRUB to install the bootloader 
on the boot record of our floppy; we'll look at this in more detail later.

Booting from HD
---------------
1. Start GRUB by booting floppy generated above.

2. Specify GRUB root particion:

	root (		(press TAB)
	root (hd0,	(press TAB)

		Possible partitions are:
		Partition num: 0, Filesystem type is ext2fs, partition type 0x83
		Partition num: 1, Filesystem type unknown, partition type 0x82
		Partition num: 2, Filesystem type unknown, partition type 0x7
		Partition num: 4, Filesystem type is reiserfs, partition type 0x83
		Partition num: 5, Filesystem type is reiserfs, partition type 0x83	

	root (hd0, 4)

3. Load kernel, for example:

	kernel /boot/vmlinuz root=/dev/hda5

Notice the "root=" kernel parameter, which is very important. It should point to the Linux
partition that holds your root filesystem.

4. Start boot

	boot


Boot methods
------------
GRUB has two distinct boot methods. One of the two is to load an
operating system directly, and the other is to chain-load another boot
loader which then will load an operating system actually. 

Load another boot loader to boot unsupported operating systems
--------------------------------------------------------------
  1. Set GRUB's root device to the partition by the command
     `rootnoverify' (*note rootnoverify::):

          grub> rootnoverify (hd0,0)

  2. Set the "active" flag in the partition using the command
     `makeactive' :

          grub> makeactive

  3. Load the boot loader with the command `chainloader':

          grub> chainloader +1

     `+1' indicates that GRUB should read one sector from the start of
     the partition. The complete description about this syntax can be
     found in .

  4. Run the command `boot'.
