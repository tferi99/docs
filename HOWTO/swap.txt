How to create a new swap device ?
=================================
First you have to create a new partition with fdisk:
- call fdisk [-u device]
- add a new partition 
- set type (system id) of new partition to 82 (Linux swap)
- write modified data (maybe you have to reboot after that)

Make a swap area on new partition:
	mkswap -c <device>

List available swap areas:
	swapon -s 
or	
	swapoff -s 

or 
	cat /proc/swaps

Switch off all active swap areas:
	swapoff -a 

Note:
	swapon/swapoff use /etc/fstab to get information about swap areas

Insert new device into /etc/fstab and delete unnecesary swap entries (if you want to activate a new spaw area instead of an old one), for example:

	/dev/hdc2	swap	swap	defaults   0   0

Acxtivate swap area(s):
	swapon -a
