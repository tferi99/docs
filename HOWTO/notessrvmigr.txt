Lotus Notes Server migration
============================

Data of Notes server can be migrated to another machine.

Migration
---------
1. Install notes server.
2. You have to copy the following files:
	- Domino\notes.ini
	- Domino\Data\*.id
	- Domino\Data\names.nsf
	- Domino\Data\mail\*.nsf

3. You have to delete mail index files if exist.
4. Server DNS names must be resolved on new machines (maybe in hosts).



Additional changes
------------------
1. First time network function was not working.
   I've changed the following entry in notes.ini, because network interface was not found:

   LAN1ip=NETBIOS, 1, 15, 0

	to

   LAN1ip=NETBIOS, 0, 15, 0


2. Changes by log:

Log entry:
	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\PriorityControl\Win32PrioritySeparation
	is currently set to 2. 
	For better server performance, change the setting to 0 

	Done.
