McAffee tips
============
McAffee in our company protects files of browsers, so you are not able to delete there files.

But there is a workaround, you can uninstall temporary McAffee (for a few minutes):


	msiexec /x "c:\Program Files\McAfee\VirusScan Enterprise\RepairCache\vse850.msi"
	
	
,so you will able to delete everything until McAffee installed again by policy rules.
