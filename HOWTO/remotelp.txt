
Set default printer to a printer on remote host providing lpd:

Edit row with 'lp' as first token in /etc/printcap:

lp:rm=ntserver:hp6l

In this example 'ntserver' is a Windown NT Server and 'hp6l' is a shared printer. You have to install and configure lpd to NT Server.

After this settings you can print a text file directly calling by lpr.
