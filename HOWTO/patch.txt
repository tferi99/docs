Howto create/use patch file?
============================

Creating patch file
-------------------

	diff -cr orig-directory new-directory > patchfile


Using patch file
----------------

	patch -pNum < patchfile

Info from 'man pathc'

-pnum  or  --strip=num
	Strip  the  smallest  prefix  containing  num   leading
    slashes from each file name found in the patch file.  A
    sequence of one or more adjacent slashes is counted  as
    a  single slash.  This controls how file names found in
    the patch file are treated, in case you keep your files
    in  a  different directory than the person who sent out
    the patch.  For example, supposing the file name in the
    patch file was

		/u/howard/src/blurfl/blurfl.c

   setting  -p0 gives the entire file name unmodified, -p1
   gives

		u/howard/src/blurfl/blurfl.c

   without the leading slash, -p4 gives

		blurfl/blurfl.c
