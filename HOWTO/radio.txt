Using SoundForte16 Radio Tuner Card
-----------------------------------

SF16 is a radio tuner card, my card is integrated with a ISA PnP SoundBlaster 16 card.

There are two ways:

1. 2.2.x kernel supports Video4Linux, and there are many programs use this interface. To install it maybe you have to recompile kernel.
You have to enable the following kernel configuration variables (make xconfig):
	Character devices/Video4Linux/Video for Linux -> y
	Character devices/Video4Linux/SF16FMI -> y (with a fix port setting) or m

Video4Linux has a device for tuner cands: /dev/radio. This device is used by programs supported by Video4Linux.

I couldn't configure this method properly yet, because /dev/radio wasn't correct.

2. Direct using by radio program.
This program's been developed directly for SF16 cards.
To use it you have to compile it. Source file is: radio-2.0-3.src.rpm

Before creating Makefile you have to generate a /etc/isapnp.conf file with entries for SF16 card (irq, io). Than you have to call runme_first to create Makefile.

Running:	radio
See also:	radio -h

There is a tool with simple user interface to make using easier:
			radii

, it reads ~/.xradiorc configuration file that can storage 10 radio stations.
