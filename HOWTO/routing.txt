Routing
=======

One of the purposes of subnetting is that it forms the basis for routing. Here's the routing table on my firewall:

root# netstat -nr
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flgs MSS Win irtt Iface
192.168.9.1     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.255 UH   40  0      0 texas
206.124.146.177 0.0.0.0         255.255.255.255 UH   40  0      0 eth1

192.168.3.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U    40  0      0 eth3
192.168.2.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U    40  0      0 eth1
192.168.1.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U    40  0      0 eth2
206.124.146.0   0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U    40  0      0 eth0
192.168.9.0     192.0.2.223     255.255.255.0   UG   40  0      0 texas
127.0.0.0       0.0.0.0         255.0.0.0       U    40  0      0 lo
0.0.0.0         206.124.146.254 0.0.0.0         UG   40  0      0 eth0

The device texas is a GRE tunnel to a peer site in the Dallas, Texas area.
The first three routes are host routes since they indicate how to get to a single host. 
In the “netstat” output this can be seen by the “Genmask” (Subnet Mask) of 255.255.255.255 
and the “H” in the Flags column. The remainder are “net” routes since they tell the kernel 
how to route packets to a subnetwork. The last route is the default route and the gateway 
mentioned in that route is called the default gateway.

When the kernel is trying to send a packet to IP address A, it starts at the top of the routing table and:

- A is logically ANDed with the “Genmask” value in the table entry.

- The result is compared with the “Destination” value in the table entry.

- If the result and the “Destination” value are the same, then:

- If the “Gateway” column is non-zero, the packet is sent to the gateway over the interface named in the “Iface” column.

- Otherwise, the packet is sent directly to A over the interface named in the “iface” column.

- Otherwise, the above steps are repeated on the next entry in the table.

Since the default route matches any IP address (A LAND 0.0.0.0 = 0.0.0.0), packets that don't match any 
of the other routing table entries are sent to the default gateway which is usually a router at your ISP. 
Lets take an example. Suppose that we want to route a packet to 192.168.1.5. That address clearly doesn't 
match any of the host routes in the table but if we logically and that address with 255.255.255.0, the 
result is 192.168.1.0 which matches this routing table entry:

192.168.1.0   0.0.0.0       255.255.255.0   U     40  0         0 eth2

So to route a packet to 192.168.1.5, the packet is sent directly over eth2.
