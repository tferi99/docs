How to prevent a child process from being a zombie?
===================================================

When a child process exits, it will be a zombie until parent process calls a wait() or a waitpid(). So if we don't call a wait() in parent child will be zombie.
When a parent exits earlier than child, the child will be adopted by init. So init will be responsible for cleaning up child.

Zombie is a process table entry about a dead process to hold its exit status. It don't consume other resources, but it reserves one process entry, that can make trouble by running out the process table.

To prevent this we can do the followings:
1. Call wait() or waitpid() in parent.
2. If you don't want to wait, you can handle SIGCHLD signal and you can call waitpid() or wait3().
3. Call for twice, so child will be adopted by init.
