CVS tips
========

To set user privilegs
---------------------
If 'writers' file doesn't exist in CVSROOT directory, everybody has write access.
If exists, users in this file can write.

To set user password
--------------------
Generate password with crypt.pl and write into CVSROOT/passwd.
You can use settpasswd script (see: D:\inst\cvs\scripts\setpassword).
