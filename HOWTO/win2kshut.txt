Customizing the Logon Process in Windows NT4/ Windows2000
---------------------------------------------------------

You can customize the logon process.
To do so, run the "regedt32.exe". and all the followings should be done under, 

\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\WinLogon

Removing the Default Username

By default, the user name of the last person to successfully log on to Windows NT is displayed in the WINLOGON dialog box. 
You can make this not to display any user name at the WINLOGON dialog box.
Click "Edit>Add Value".
And at Value Name, type "DontDisplayLastUserName" and leave the Data Type as "REG_SZ", and click OK.
And when the string box pops up, type value "1" to display a blank username field, and value "0" to display the last username.

Display a Security Warning Message

You can make Windows NT to display a pop-up warning message just before displaying the WINLOGON dialog box.
Each time a user presses Ctrl+Art+Del, the warning will appear and the OK button must be clicked before logon can be attempted. 
To do so, double click on the "LegalNoticeCaption" value. When the string box pops up, write the cation. (example : Warning ).
And double click on the "LegalNoticeText" value, and enter the string. (example : Someone's Watching You !)
To terminate the warning display, just clear the contents of each value.

Disabling the Shutdown Button

The Shutdown button is displayed at the WINLOGON prompt, by default.
To disable it, double click on "ShutdownWithoutLogon", and enter value "1" to enable the button, and "0" to disable the button.

Logon Automation

You can make Windows NT to eliminate the need to press Ctrl+Alt+Del, type in a username and password, and just logon automatically.
To do so, enter the string values of "DefaultUserName", and "DefaultPassword".
If you don't see the values of those, you can edit them by clicking "Edit>Add Value", and name the Value Name for example "DafualtPassword", and leave the Data
Type as "REG_SZ", and write the string.
Another thing is to add the "AutoAdminLogon" value, and set the string as "1" to automate the logon, and "0" to disable it.

Customizing the Logon Process in Windows2000

In Windows 2000, you no more have to edit the registry.
You can do it at Start>Programs>Admin Tools>Domain Security Policy
Expand the "Security Settings", expand the "Local Policy", and double click the "Security Option" of the left pane.
Double click the "Don't display the last logon username on the logon screen", and select the box, and select Enable.
