Howto handle devices from command line in XP
============================================

Use devcon.exe .

The DevCon utility is a command-line utility that acts as an alternative to Device Manager. 
Using DevCon, you can enable, disable, restart, update, remove, and query individual devices 
or groups of devices. DevCon also provides information that is relevant to the driver developer 
and is not available in Device Manager.

See: 
	devcon help
	devcon help <command> 

Device Console Help:
devcon [-r] [-m:\\<machine>] <command> [<arg>...]
-r if specified will reboot machine after command is complete, if needed.
<machine> is name of target machine.
<command> is command to perform (see below).
<arg>... is one or more arguments if required by command.
For help on a specific command, type: devcon help <command>

To restart a device (e.g. a network device due to moving PC and changing network) use

	devcon disable <hardware ID>
	devcon enable <hardware ID>

To retrieve a hardware ID, redirect output into a file, find the appropriate 
driver section and choose one from avaialable IDs:

	devcon hwids * > ids.txt

For example a network driver section:
..........
..........
..........
PCI\VEN_8086&DEV_1031&SUBSYS_02091014&REV_42\4&139E449D&0&40F0
    Name: Intel(R) PRO/100 VE Network Connection
    Hardware ID's:
        PCI\VEN_8086&DEV_1031&SUBSYS_02091014&REV_42
        PCI\VEN_8086&DEV_1031&SUBSYS_02091014
        PCI\VEN_8086&DEV_1031&CC_020000
        PCI\VEN_8086&DEV_1031&CC_0200
    Compatible ID's:
        PCI\VEN_8086&DEV_1031&REV_42
        PCI\VEN_8086&DEV_1031
        PCI\VEN_8086&CC_020000
        PCI\VEN_8086&CC_0200
        PCI\VEN_8086
        PCI\CC_020000
        PCI\CC_0200

Result script:

	devcon disable "PCI\VEN_8086&DEV_1031&CC_0200"
	devcon enable "PCI\VEN_8086&DEV_1031&CC_0200"
