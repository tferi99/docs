Howto install X-Server + KDE
============================
Install KDE in debian

	apt-get install x-window-system-core kde

You'll probably also want to install KDM, for the KDE-style login screen.

	apt-get install kdm

you may need to start X-Server if it is not running, to start it run

	startx

To start KDE each time (you probably want this) you'll need to edit your startup files. If you use KDM or XDM to log in, edit .xsession, otherwise edit .xinitrc or .Xclients.

Install Gnome in Debian

	apt-get install gnome
