How to auto-deploy on Tomcat
============================

Tomcat 4.x
----------
- Any XML file in the 

	$CATALINA_HOME/webapps


Tomcat 4.x, 5.x
----------
- Any XML file in the 

	$CATALINA_HOME/conf/[engine_name]/[host_name]

directory is assumed to contain a Context element (and its associated subelements) for a single web application. 
The docBase attribute of this <Context> element will typically be the absolute pathname to a web application directory, 
or the absolute pathname of a web application archive (WAR) file (which will not be expanded).

- Any web application archive file that does not have a corresponding directory of the same name 
(without the ".war" extension) will be automatically expanded, unless the unpackWARs property is set to false. 
If you redeploy an updated WAR file, be sure to delete the expanded directory when restarting Tomcat, 
so that the updated WAR file will be re-expanded (note that the auto deployer will automatically take care of this if it is enabled).

- Any subdirectory within the application base directory that appears to be an unpacked web application 
(that is, it contains a /WEB-INF/web.xml file) will receive an automatically generated Context element, 
even if this directory is not mentioned in the conf/server.xml file. 
This generated Context entry will be configured according to the properties set in any DefaultContext 
element nested in this Host element. The context path for this deployed Context will be a slash 
character ("/") followed by the directory name, unless the directory name is ROOT, in which case the 
context path will be an empty string ("").
