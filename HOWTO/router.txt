Router settings

Requirements:
	- installed networks
	- router tables
	- enabling IP forwarding


To list network interfaces:
	
	ifconfig


To list routing table:

	route

An example from an output of route:

Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
192.168.0.0     *               255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth1
134.0.0.0       *               255.255.0.0     U     0      0        0 eth0
loopback        *               255.0.0.0       U     0      0        0 lo
default         134.0.0.115     0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 eth0

We can see destination networks (e.g. 192.168.0.0 - 255.255.255.0), and the interfaces (eth1) that provide routes for packages going to hosts of these networks.

All package for network 192.168.0.0. goes through the interface eth1.
If the destination of a package isn't in any network of routing table, it goes to default destination (134.0.0.115).

If we would like to be possible package routing for exernal sources, we have to enable IP forwarding. 

In elder kernel we have to set CONFIG_IP_FORWARD parameter to 'yes', and recompile the kernel.

For kernels newer then 2.1.102 we can issue the following command:

	echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

In SuSE we can set it in /etc/rc/config:

	IP_FORWARD=yes

During booting /sbin/init.d/boot will call the command above.

We can detect IP forwarding by reading /proc/sys/nete/ipv4/ip_forward.

On client machines we have to set our router as (default) gateway, if they want to send packages to hosts on the other network.
