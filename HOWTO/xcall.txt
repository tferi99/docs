If you want to call X programs from another host, then first you have to
enable to the another host to use your X server. This you can perform
by calling:

	xhost + <another host>

This setting you should do after every system restarting.

Then you have to telnet to another host, and on the another host call the 
needed program with target display parameter:

	<program> -display <your host>:0

There is a method to simplify this tasks:
For example your IP address is 134.0.0.113, and the address of another
host is 134.0.0.165.
1. Insert the following row into your .xinitrc :

	xhost + 134.0.0.165

2. If you specify default display by setting DISPLAY environment variable,
so you don't need specify -display parameter at calling an X programm.
You can do this in a central initialization file on another host, for example 
in .profile of user where you will telnet by the following:
	
	if [ "$DISPLAY" = "tferi:0.0" ]
	then
	  DISPLAY="134.0.0.113:0.0"
	fi

, where 'tferi' is your machine name. DISPLAY variable will be set to your
IP address.  This address resolution necessary when there isn't another address resolution service (hosts, DNS).

After this you have to telnet into another host, and simple call the needed
X programm.

To enable connection to everybody run:

	xhost +
