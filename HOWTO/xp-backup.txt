XP Backup/Restore
=================

Backup scripts are stored in 

	"C:\Documents and Settings\$USER\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\Windows NT\NTBackup\data\*.bks"


Creating backup script
----------------------
1. Call 'Backup Utility for Windows' (%SystemRoot%\system32\ntbackup.exe or Start/Programs/Accesories/System Tools/Backup).
2. On 'Backup' tab you can specify files to backup, and save script (Job/Save selections).


NOTES:
- You can load and modify existing backup scripts as well.
- You view list of files to backup in backup script files (*.bks).



Scheduling backup
-----------------
1. After saving a new backup script or loading an old one, press 'StartBackup' button on 'Backup' tab.
2. Press 'Schedule...' button on the right side.
3. Specify account for the task.
4. Set schedule time

   NOTE: I've tried my own user account but it cannot work since it is in Administrators group, so finally
         I've set 'administrator' for this task.
