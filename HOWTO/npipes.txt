
How can you use named pipes ?

Named pipes are pipes that can be used by separated processes to communicate to each other. They are physically pipes, but we can see them as files.

If a process reads from a name pipe file, and somebody writes into this file, the written data will be read by reader process.

To create a named pipe:
	
	mknod /tmp/testpipe p
or
	mkfifo a=rw /tmp/testpipe

To read a named pipe bind this file simply to the standard input of a process:

	cat /tmp/testpipe

Writing is simailar:

	echo alma > /tmp/testpipe

You can find samples about named an general pipes in /u/c_src/ipc/pipe? directories.
