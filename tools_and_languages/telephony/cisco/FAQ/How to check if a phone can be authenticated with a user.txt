How to check if a phone can be authenticated with a user?
=========================================================
To check if a user (Application user, End user) authorized to a phone

To get URL:
- enable WEB access on phone
- go into phone with a browser
- get URL from 'Authentication URL' field. It's looks liek this:

		http://CUCM_HOST:PORT/ccmcip/authenticate.jsp?...
	
	e.g.:

		http://192.168.5.18:8080/ccmcip/authenticate.jsp?UserID=test9002&Password=12345&devicename=SEP64A0E714F271
		
Result is a string value:	AUTHORIZED / UN-AUTHORIZED


DEVELOPER NOTE:
	You can override this URL 
		- in CUCM level:	
		- in device level:	CUCM/Deveice/[External Data Locations Information]/(Secure Authentication URL)
		
		If a protected device resource is tried to be accessed via HTTP the client should be authenticated. 
		If URL is not overridden the default URL (see above) will be connected.
		Othervise you can implement an authentication proxy HTTP service. You can call the original authentication 
		function if you forward request to the original URL from the proxy application.
		
		Default:
			Device  ----> client
			
		Overridden:
			Device  ----> PROXY ----> client
