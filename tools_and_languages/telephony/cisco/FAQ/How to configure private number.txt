How to configure private number?
================================

Scenario: 9002 calls 9000 and we want to configure caller (9002) when calling 9000.

Normal CSS and partitions:	

	TOTH_Intern
		- TOTH_Phones
		
- Create a new CSS for private callers: TOTH_CSS_Private and a partition for private feature (TOTH_Private) and put partitions into CSS:

	TOTH_CSS_Private
		- TOTH_Private
		- TOTH_Phones
		
- Create a translation pattern where DN is the called target and set 
	- Calling Line ID Presentation
	- Calling Name Presentation
	
	to Restricted.
	Set normal CSS for translation pattern.
	
- Put caller line (9002) into CSS TOTH_CSS_Private.
- Put translation pattern into partition TOTH_Private.

If 9002 calls 9000 caller phone number won't be displayed on called device.

How does it work?
-----------------
- If caller (9002) calls anything target will be routed by TOTH_CSS_Private because it's the CSS of 9002.

- Because translation pattern DN (9000) is part of TOTH_Private and it's the first partiotion in CSS 9000 will be 
	found as translation pattern.
	
- Restricted presentation will hide calling number.

- Because translation pattern is not a real number jiust a translator and route option is route. So it will be routed forward.
	CSS of TP is the normal CSS, so 9000 will be called in the next partition (TOTH_Phones).
	
- If you call other numbers from 9002 which CSS is TOTH_CSS_Private these numbers will be found in second partition of CSS (TOTH_Phones).



9002 ---> TOTH_CSS_Private ---> TOTH_Private ---> Translation pattern (9000) ---> Normal number (9000) in TOTH_Phones, where caller is hidden.
