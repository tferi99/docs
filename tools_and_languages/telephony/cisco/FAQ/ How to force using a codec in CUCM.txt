 How to force using a codec in CUCM?
====================================

Method 1 - CUCM Service Parameters:

	For example: 	G.711 A-Law 

	Change configuration: 

		- CUCM/System/Service Parameters:			select CUCM server
		- Service:									Cisco CallManager
		
		G.711 A-law Codec Enabled:					Enabled for All Devices
		G.711 mu-law Codec Enabled:					Disabled

		
		
Method 2 - CUCM region:

	SEE ALSO:		Cisco Unified Communications Manager Administration Guide/System setup/Region setup

	- Create a Codec Preference List:		CUCM/System/REgion Information/Audio Codec Preference List
		- copy from other old one
		- push your favorite codec to the beginning of the list
		- Save

	- Create a region:			CUCM/System/Region Information/Region
		- Add new
		- Build 'Region Relationships' matrix where you specify rules, how to choose codec 
			when you have a call with 2 phones and these phones reside in Region-1 and Region-2
			
	- Create a device pool:		CUCM/System/Device Pool
	
		Assign your region to this pool.
		
	- Assign a phone to this pool.
	
	Test:
		- enable WEB access of this phone
		- make a call to this phone
		- open: Streaming statistics log (Stream 1?), here you can check:
			- status of device
			- Sender/Rcvr Codec
