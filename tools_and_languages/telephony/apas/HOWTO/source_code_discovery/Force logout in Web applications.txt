Force logout in Web applications
================================

APAS/Client/Active Clients/(Force Logout)

This function force logout clients in 2 steps:
- it deletes connection
- it sends a ForceLogout Atmosphere event to client appication

--> activeclient_gwtappMain.RemoteDoClientRemoteControl("forceLogout", getKeys())
	-- RPC --> RPCandmobileServiceImpl.RemoteDoClientRemoteControl()
		----------------------------------- loop on keys --------------------------------------
		- key: id#serverType
			--> server = JTAPIThread.CLIENTCORE.getServer(type)
			--> connection = server.getClientConnectionByID(id)
			--> service = ServiceLocator.getWebXXXConnectionService();
			--> service.notifyWebByUser(ForceLogoutWebEvt)
			--> service.removeConnection(username)
	

- It does not make a logout in SpringSescurity. It will be peformed by client itself after receiving Atmosphere event.
- So if browser is closed during ForceLogout event, server side still keeps session. In this case session will be cleaned up by keepalive mechanism or server session timeout.
