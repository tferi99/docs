Howto add MA configuration?
===========================
MA : Manager/Assistant

MA features
-----------
- caller knows DN of manager but it cannot call it directly
- caller calls manager, but an RP routes call to an assistant or a manger directly
- if call routed to an assistant it can make a consultative call to manager and can bind caller to manager later

Configuration
-------------
CM:
	- Managers and assistants must be in the same partition (e.g. PT_Phones).
	- add CTI Route point with proxy DN which is the same as DN of manager but with brackets (e.g. 900[1]) and add it to a different partition (e.g. PT_Managers)
		- add RP to your application user
	- CTI RP name prefix should be: APH_RP_GROUP 
		or change prefix in APAS (Apas/Group/Settings/Manager Assistant Options - Route Points Prefix)
		
	- you need at least 2 partitions:
		- for manager RP (PT_Managers)
		- for manager, assistants, caller (PT_Phones)
		
	- you need at least at least 2 CSS:
		- CSS assigned to caller, where order of partitions: PT_Managers, PT_Phones (CSS_MA_clients)
			It won't be able to access manager directly
		- CSS assigned to manager-RP, manager, assistants
			They can access manager directly
		
		--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		PT_Phones:
			- manager, assistants, caller
		
		PT_Managers
			- manager-RP
		
		CSS_MA_clients
			- PT_Managers
			- PT_Phones
			
		CSS_Intern
			- PT_Phones
		
		
		
Apas:
	- Add MA configuration:		APAS/Group/Manager List
		
		- Manager Extension: same as DN in RP - e.g. 900[0]
		- Partition for Manager Phone is 'None' in a simple scenario
		- Assign assistants
		- Set other options


How does it work?
-----------------
	- caller calls manager DN which will call RP
	- if requirement is calling manager directly RP will call the same DN but this DN will be found in PT_Phones partition (e.g. VIP caller)
	OR
	- RP will call an agent in PT_Phones partition
