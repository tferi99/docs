Howto build recorder?
=====================
The most simple way to build recorder is using the Jenkins because all dependencies installed there.

Use case:
	- Checkout source into you development environment (Windows).
	- Edit source code in Eclipse CDT.
	- Share source directory to Jenkins
	- Build sources there
	- Deploy recorder executable to ISO APAS.

	
Step for build environment:
	
1. Checkout SVN (https://uk-svn-001.edge.local/svn/Andtek.andphone_record/trunk/src/andphone_record) to your developer environment.

2. Mount source directory to Jenkins:

	Pre-requisities:
	
		- add your user:
				
			adduser ftoth
			
		- crate mount point:
		
			mkdir -p /mnt/ftoth/andphone_record
			chown ftoth:ftoth /mnt/ftoth/andphone_record
			
		- install CIFS if missing:
		
			- check if CIFS installed:		yum list installed | grep -i cifs
			- if not installed:
				- search CIFS:				yum search cifs
				- install:					yum install cifs-utils.x86_64
			
	- share your recorder source directory from Windows with 'Full control' as 'andphone_record'
	
	- there are 2 ways to access windows shares:
		1. open INCOMING ports 139 and 445
		OR
		2. SSH with REMOTE tunneling

		1. If Windows ports (139 and 445) are opened then you can access them direcly:
	
			mount -t cifs -o username=ftoth //WIN_IP/andphone_record /mnt/ftoth/andphone_record
		
		2. with remote tunneling:
		
			- add REMOTE tunneling to you SSH config:		R 50445:localhost:445
			- mount:
			
				mount -t cifs -o username=ftoth,port=50445 //127.0.0.1/andphone_record /mnt/ftoth/andphone_record
				
		NOTE: 
			You can add permanent configuratin to /etc/fstab:
		
				//127.0.0.1/andphone_record     /mnt/ftoth/andphone_record      cifs    user,uid=1000,rw,suid,port=50445,username=ftoth,noauto 0 0
			
			Where 1000 is your UID of you Linux user (from /etc/passwd).
			This way you can simply mount your remote directory with:
			
				mount /mnt/ftoth/andphone_record 
		
2. Build project
	- login:	su - ftoth

	- go to project directory:	cd /mnt/ftoth/andphone_record

	- ant

		It calls 'cmake'
		
			cmake
				-> CMakeLists.txt
					-> find_package()
						It find packages. CMake searches for a file called "Find<package>.cmake" in the CMAKE_MODULE_PATH followed by the CMake installation. 
						If the file is found, it is read and processed by CMake. 
						It is responsible for finding the package, checking the version, and producing any needed messages. 
						
						(Here CMAKE_MODULE_PATH:	 ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake)

						
			
3. Artifact generated into 'build' directory.


TIPS:
	If you move project into another directory delete PROJECT_DIR/build and call ant again. 
	It will re-generate makefiles (cmake).
