The Cisco IP telephony network establishes and maintains:
- authenticated communication streams
- digitally signs files before transferring the file to the phone
- encrypts media streams
- encrypts call signaling between Cisco Unified IP Phones

How to configure secure JTAPI

Secured SIP Trunk Recording Configuration
=========================================
This configuration is necessary to encrypt SIP communication between CUCM and APAS in order to allow the recording of encrypted calls (sRTP). 
The central task to enable secure SIP is to exchange valid certificates between CUCM and APAS.

Configure a non-secure configuration, except:

- CUCM should be in mixed mode (VERY IMPORTANT)

	To get mode:	CUCM/System/Enterprise Parameters/[Security Parameters]/(Cluster Security Mode)		: 1 (means mixed mode; 0: means non-secure mode)

- Create Secure SIP Encrypted Phone Security Profile (see PDF doc) for every recorded phone type if it does not exist yet.
	
- Set security profile for phones with profile created before:

	APAS/Device/Phone//[Protocol Specific Information]/(Device Security Profile)
	
- Create APAS certificate (if missing or expired) and import into CUCM:
	- APAS/Global/Security/[Certificate List]/(Create APAS Certificate)
	- APAS/Global/Security/[Certificate List]/Export (icon on items)
	- CUCM OS Admin/Security/Certificate Management/(Upload certificate)	
		- Certificate Name: Select Callmanager-trust
		- Description: Unique description for this certificate
		- Upload File: Upload the .pem file which was earlier downloaded from the APAS.
	
- Export CallManager cert from CUCM and import into APAS

		- CUCM OS Admin/Security/Certificate Management/[Certificate List]		
			- Choose item 'Callmanager'
			- click button 'Download .PEM file' in dialog
		- APAS/Global/Security/[Certificat List]/(Import Trusted Certificate)

- SIP Trunk Security Profile

		- Name : Unique name
		- Device Security Profile : Encrypted
		- Incoming Transport Type :TLS
		- Outgoing Transport Type: TLS
		- X.509 Subject name: Must be the CN value. (APAS IP ADDRESS)
		- In our example CN=192.168.150.196, which is the IP address of the APAS
		- Incoming Port : 5061

- SIP Trunk	
	- Device Protocol > SIP
	- Device Pool: select a device pool which uses G711 to the APAS
	- Destination Address: IP address of the APAS
	- Destination Port: 5061 or above
	- SIP Trunk Security Profile > Secure SIP TLS Trunk Profile (this profile was configured previously)
	- SRTP Allowed: SRTP must be checked.
	- SIP Profile: Standard SIP Profile
	- Enable Recording gateway:
			
			Recording Information:		This trunk connects to a recording-enabled gateway

NOTE:
	Port in SIP TRunk and SIP Trunk Security Profile should be 5061. 
	Other port does not work in my environment.
	
- Create recording profile and route pattern as you create it for non-secure recording
	and associate them together and to trunk.

Phones: same as non-secure, but:
	- Device security profile: select device specific SIP SECURE profile

APAS: SIP configuration same as non-secure, except:
	- Port: 5061
	- Username: choose user configured for secure recording
	- Transport: TLS
	- Use SSL: unchecked (This setting is typically used for SFTP)
	- Priority: Multiple Servers can be configured under a single SIP Server and priority can be set for each server.
	- Local Port: 5061
