How to activate recorder2?
==========================

APAS 5 :
 
	insert into config (module, param, val) values ('recorder', 'useRecorder2', true);
	
NOTE:
	With current implementation the value of variable is not relevant.
	If you want to reset recorder 1, delete this record (and NOT update).
	
	
Deactivate:	
	
	delete from config where param = 'useRecorder2';
