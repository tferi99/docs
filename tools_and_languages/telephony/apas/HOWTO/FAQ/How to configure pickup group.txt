How to configure pickup group?
==============================

- Create a group

- Assign members

- Set 

	APAS/Group/GroupL List/[Group Attributes]/(Popup Pickup Service)
	
	
If you call any member of this group a pickup popup will be displayed on other members, too.
So other members will be able to pick up the call.
