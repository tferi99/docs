How to configure a Busy Pilot?
==============================
Busy pilot is a normal pilot where queue doesn't have any agents and DN of pilot has been added to busy pilot list.

In ACD if you want to detect 'no agent' state as busy you have to bind a busy pilot to your queue.
In this case if there is no agent in ACD queue (all agents are in break, unavailable, ...), call will be forwarded to busy pilot.
The role of busy pilot is just playing a pre-queue media and its DN can be add to busy pilot list of statistics configuration.


Configure:
- Add a line to ACD route point.
- Add a queue without agents.
- Set Pre-queue-media.
- Add a new pilot and associate queue.
- Specify pilot DN as 'No Agents Target' of the last ACD queue.
- Add busy pilot DN to statistics report descriptor JSP. This JSP can be edited/uploaded here:

	Here find BusyPilot... variables.
