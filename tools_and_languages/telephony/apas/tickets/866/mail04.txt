Hi Prem,

so I generated a new certificate with the discussed options using openssl.
It is still not working, the error remains the same.
Are you sure you know how a working certificate should look like or if secure sip is even working?

Attached you find a new trace, a screenshot from CUCM as well as the certificate.
In the trace, look for communication between 192.168.150.170 (application
server) and 192.168.5.17 (cucm).

Hello Jens,

If you are using java version 7 and the keytool command to generate certificates, it looks like the "certificate sign" attribute can be set.
Check this link:

http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/windows/keytool.html

The option to use is "-ext".

Can you use openssl instead?

Thank you,

Hi Prem,

no news so far. It turns out we use a java API to create the certificate and it is not really easy to find out if this API supports the requested changes and if yes, how to do it.
We are still investigating.

I will inform you, if there is any progress.
