Calculation steps:
	1. buildTablesFromAcdHistory(sm, categoryType) 				: Building category total and history tables from ACD history using a state machine.
	2. calculateVariables(sm, categoryType)						: Calculating category statistics variables from total and history tables.
	
	sm : StateMachine
	categoryType : current category type for calculation is performing
	
buildTablesFromAcdHistory()
	1. collecting category information into categoriesTotal

	---------------------------------- loop on ACD call history (ACDCallState items) ------------------------------------------
	INIT
		- initialization of state machine with current ACDCallState
		- getting pilot from current ACDCallState
		- on last ACD state get end timestamp
		- checking if it's an external outgoing call
		- getting site of caller DN
		- finding category for the current ACD history entry
		- setting busy state of call 
		condition: if category not found but we are not in the last ACD entry then: CONTINUE LOOP
