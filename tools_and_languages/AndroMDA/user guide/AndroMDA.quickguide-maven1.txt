1. Installation
---------------
1. Install Java

2. Maven

======== Maven1 ========
		- uncompress maven-1.0.2.tar.gz
		- set MAVEN_HOME to maven directory
======== Maven2 ========
		- uncompress maven-2.0.4-bin.zip
		- set M2_HOME to maven directory
		
3. Set the following environment variables:

JAVA_HOME 	Java installation directory, e.g. C:\Program Files\Java/jdk1.5.0 (REQUIRED)
MAVEN_HOME 	Maven installation directory, e.g. C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Maven 1.0.2 
		(this may have already been set by the Maven installer) (REQUIRED)
MAVEN_OPTS 	Parameters to pass to the Java VM when running Maven. Set this value to: 

			-XX:MaxPermSize=128m -Xmx512m 

		(required to build large maven projects such as AndroMDA itself) (NOT REQUIRED)
PATH 		This makes sure the system will search for console commands in the directories listed here. 
		If this property already exists you should simply add %JAVA_HOME%\bin;%MAVEN_HOME%\bin
		(REQUIRED)

4. Install AndroMDA with Maven

======== Maven1 ========
	- You can easily install AndroMDA + Maven plugin:
	- create build.properties into your HOME ("C:\Documents and Settings\$USER\build.properties)
	  with the following content:

		maven.repo.remote=http://www.ibiblio.org/maven,http://team.andromda.org/maven
		
	  This will set AndroMDA file server.


	- download AndroMDA Maven plugins:

		maven plugin:download -DgroupId=andromda -DartifactId=maven-andromdapp-plugin -Dversion=3.2-RC1

======== Maven2 ========
	- Unzip the contents of the installer into your Maven repository at C:\Documents and Settings\your user name\.m2\repository.
	- Verify that the following directory was created:
		C:\Documents and Settings\your user name\.m2\repository\org\andromda\maven\plugins\andromda-maven-plugin
		
		
2. Goals in Andromda project
----------------------------
======== Maven1 ========
	Read readme.txt after generating project, is there a lot of usable information.

	install		: Builds everything and installs it into the local Maven repository
	clean		: get rid of all the log files
	nuke		: Cleans Everything and deletes all implementation classes

	start-andromda-server	: Starts the AndroMDA server
	stop-andromda-server	: Stops the AndroMDA server
	create-schema	: Initializes the database schema for this application
	drop-schema	: Drops the database schema for this application
	execute-script	: Executes the given DDL script



3. Creating projects
--------------------

	maven andromdapp:generate

You have to answer some questions, and project directory tree will be generated.

Generated project directory (in fact, the project directory contains a hierarchy of Maven projects 
as shown below):

timetracker
     |
     |-- mda
     |
     |-- common
     |
     |-- core
     |
     |-- web
     |
     +-- app

timetracker: 
	This is the master project that controls the overall build process and common properties. 
mda: 
	The mda project is the most important sub-project of the application. 
	It houses the TimeTracker UML model under the src/uml directory. The mda project is also 
	where AndroMDA is configured to generate the files needed to assemble the application. 

mda/src:
	Where the UML model file is located. 

mda/conf:
	Where the AndroMDA engine configuration file is located. 

common: 
	The common sub-project collects resources and classes that are shared among other sub-projects. 
	These include value objects and embedded values. 
core:	
	The core sub-project collects resources and classes that use the Spring framework,
	optionally making use of Hibernate and/or EJBs under the hood. These include entity 
	classes, data access objects, hibernate mapping files and services. 

core/target:
	Where the code generator places most of the resulting files.  The SQL schema files are found in this directory. 
	Java source files are found in the src/ sub-directory. You may view this code for study, but do not make any 
	modifications to it, as it will be overwritten on subsequent runs of the code generator. 

core/src:
	Source files that require manual implementation go here.  Files in this directory will NOT be overwritten 
	on subsequent runs of the code generator. 

	IMPORTANT NOTE: 
	To generate *Impl.java files into <projectDir>/core/src you HAVE to add a business operation to entity, 
	you need to mark the scope as "classifier" (by default its "instance" so the business operation will 
	show up on the entity impl instead of the DAO impl). If you're still seeing it in the target/src when you 
	try any of these methods, then that means you probably just didn't CLEAN.

web: 
	The web sub-project collects those resources and classes that make up the presentation layer. 
app: 
	The app sub-project collects those resources and classes that are required to build the .ear bundle.


For a complete description of project sub-directories, see the file < projectDir >/readme.txt


4. Building
-----------
Creating project:
	
	maven andromdapp:generate

First you have to call:

	maven

, if any neccesary file has not been downloaded yet, but after every dependencies are solved, you can call it offline:

	maven -o

You can generate only source files:

	maven -o mda

Clean:
	
	maven clean

	It cleans generated files from target directories, src directories will be untouched, these files have to 
	be deleted manually.

Clean all:

	maven nuke

	It deletes every generated files (target and src as well).

Buiding DB schema:

	maven -o create-schema


5. Generated classes 
--------------------
1. <entity>
	Entity class. Always regenerated.

2. <entity>Impl extends <entity>
	Class to add implementation of business logic for entity class. Generated only once 
	(if you add business operation to entity in model).
	ADD YOUR CUSTOM CODE HERE - BUT UNDER core/src 

3. interface <entity>Dao
	It specify DAO functions for entity. Always regenerated.

4. abstract <entity>DaoBase extends <persistence base> implements <entity>Dao
	Implements base DAO functions for entity. Always regenerated.

5. <entity>DaoImpl extends <entity>DaoBase 
	It makes possible to add additional DAO functions to entity. Generated only once 
	(if you add business operation to entity in model).
	ADD YOUR CUSTOM CODE HERE - BUT UNDER core/src 


6. Customizing/configurating generation
---------------------------------------

6.1 andromda.xml
----------------
- AndroMDA is configured through a single XML file:	andromda.xml
- XML must adhere to this XML Schema:	resources/andromda-xml.xsd

Settings:
<properties>	: global properties (validation ON/OFF, external logger, etc.)
<server>	: AndroMDA server settings
<repositories>	: it aggregates all repository elements and is used to to tell AndroMDA what repository(s) 
		  to use when processing a model. Here's an example of what the <repositories> element might contain.
<models>	: location of source model(s)
<namespaces>	: The <namespace> element is used to do two things: 
		  - Activate a cartridge (if a cartridge resides within the given namespace) 
		  - Customize the properties of a plugin (cartridge, translation-library, etc). These properties 
		    can be used to define the location to which generated files are written, what mapping files to 
		    use for different language type (i.e. JavaMappings.xml, DotNetMappings.xml, etc.), and any 
		    other aspect that a property might be used to configure.



This file contains property settings for cartridges (namespace tags).


6.2 Properties

Project properties, module versions		: $APP/build.properties
	- application name, package, version
	- JAR library versions (Hibernate, Spring, Struts, Commons, etc.)

Datasource settings				: $APP/project.properties
	- JNDI
	- JDBC driver, mapping, dialect

Locations, Hibernate settings			: $APP/mda/project.properties 
	- inheritance starategy
	- showSql
	- key generator

The file $APP/project.properties contains Maven properties that are passed down to andromda.xml 
(and other parts of the build scripts) that are project wide settings (regardless of which 
developer is currently building the system, and which version is being built).  
These include things such as JDBC configuration settings, which database dialect 
you want Hibernate to use (e.g. Hypersonic, mySQL, etc.).

The file $APP/build.properties contains Maven properties that are specific to
the version being built.


7. Database operations
----------------------
You can access database via data source.
Direct JDBC connection is suitable to create/drop schema.

Available mapping names are in $DOC/mappings/*.xml
Database mapping configuration:		sql.mappings in $APP/project.properties

Generating schema:

	M1:	maven -o create-schema
	M2:	?




9. Server
---------
In order to get the best performance out of AndroMDA some improvements have been implemented that 
will significantly speed-up the generation process, one of these improvements is the AndroMDA server.

The server has been designed to (re)load the UML model in the background thereby minimizing the resources 
needed to keep track of the latest changes. There are at least two advantages: 

1. Since the model is kept in memory all the time, the initialization routines required to load it need 
only to be executed once. Especially in the case where you're regenerating multiple times per day the 
performance gain is tremendous.

2. Changes to the model are loaded in the background, in a seperate process, and this is done automatically 
when the server detects the model has been changed. That way the new model will already have been reloaded 
by the time you want to generate code from it.

Starting:

	M1:	maven start-andromda-server 
	M2:	?

Settings:	<server> tag in andromda.xml	





10. Code generation
-------------------
Loading metamodel ---> Looking for stereotypes ---> Identifying templates ---> Generating code


1. All of the cartridges that the project requires are loaded by the engine. 

2. The engine then parses the UML model’s XMI file, CREATING AN OBJECT TREE of the model for use by the engine and the cartridge templates.  
   Metafacades are created to simplify the work of the cartridge templates. 

    The AndroMDA engine uses the Netbeans MDR (MetaData Repository) to load the UML model into memory.

3. The engine traverses the object tree, looking for classes tagged with STEREOTYPES it recognizes.

4. For each class located, the appropriate cartridge template(s) are identified and dispatched to generate code.  
   Multiple source code files may be generated for each tagged class in the model: more than one template in a 
   given cartridge may generate code for any given class; more than one cartridge may generate code for any given class.
   The default templates for a cartridge may be used, or a customized version may be used, depending on your configuration. 

5. Step #4 is repeated for every class in the model.

10.1 Metafacades
----------------
The act of generating code from the UML model requires some computation not easily handled by the simple scripting capabilities.
These all require computation handled easier in Java.
To simplify the source code templates, the Facade design pattern is used to create helper classes that shield the complexities 
of the MDR from the template.  These helper classes are called Metafacades (for meta data facades).  Each cartridge used by the 
AndroMDA engine usually contains its own set of Metafacades to aid in platform specific code generation.  It is the engine’s 
responsibility to instantiate these Metafacades for use by the source code templates.


10.2 Matching Stereotypes to Cartridges
---------------------------------------
After initializing, the AndroMDA engine traverses the UML model, LOOKING FOR CLASSES MARKED WITH A SPECIFIC STEREOTYPE.  
When it finds a stereotype it recognizes (or more specifically, a stereotype that a cartridge is known to recognize), 
the appropriate CARTRIDGE(S) IS CALLED TO GENERATE THE CODE.

- /META-INF/andromda/cartridge.xml in cartridge JAR		: cartridge descriptor
- Inside the Cartridge Descriptor, there are <template> tags
- Inside each <template> tag is a <modelElements> tag.
- Each <modelElement> is used to specify (among other things) the stereotype the template maps to.  
  This specification is done in one of two ways:

  1. Directly via an attribute of the <modelElement> tag named 'stereotype'. 
     The value of the stereotype attribute specifies the stereotype the template maps to.

  2. Indirectly via a <type> inner node.
	- The <type> node specifies the name of the Metafacade class the template uses.
	- The Metafacade’s definition is found in the Metafacade Descriptor – a file in the cartridge JAR 
	  file named /META-INF/andromda/metafacades.xml .
	- The Metafacade Descriptor contains <metafacade> tags for each metafacade used by the cartridge.  
	- Each <metafacade> tag in turn contains a <stereotype> tag which defines the name of the stereotype the metafacade maps to.


10.3 Generating code from templates
-----------------------------------
Once the AndroMDA engine has identified a class from the UML model and matched it to a cartridge,
the appropriate templates are called to generate code. 

To see all of the templates available from a particular cartridge, examine the contents of the 
cartridge’s Cartridge Descriptor file (/META-INF/andromda/cartridge.xml).

By default, AndroMDA uses the Apache Software Foundation’s Velocity template engine to generate code. 

Each template available for use in the cartridge is defined in a <template> node inside the Cartridge Descriptor.  
The <template> node contains several pieces of important information:

- path			: specifies the complete path (inside of the cartridge .JAR file) to the template file
- outlet		: attribute specifies (indirectly) the sub-directory where the source file will be written to.
			  It is actually the NAME OF A PROPERTY found in the cartridge’s namespace in the andromda.xml 
			  configuration file
- overwrite		: specifies whether or not the template will overwrite pre-existing source files
- <modelElements>	: defines the Metafacade used by the template
- <type>		: specifies the Metafacade class that the template will use
			  The <type> tag may optionally contain <property> tags. 
- <property>		: does not contain a value, then that property simply must be defined.  
			  The property might be a namespace property defined in the andromda.xml config file.


11. Mappings
------------
When modeling applications in UML for AndroMDA you will never use language or technology specific types directly. 
Instead you will use platform independent datatypes which will be mapped onto the ones you need during the code generation process. 
This allows you to target different platforms without having to edit your model.

ALL MAPPINGS CAN BE FOUND IN THE ANDROMDA-PLUGIN JAR, JUST UNZIP IT AND GO INTO /PLUGIN-RESOURCES/ANDROMDA/MAPPINGS , 
YOU CAN UNZIP THEM INTO YOUR OWN LOCATION, EDIT THEM, AND USE THEM TO OVERRIDE THE DEFAULTS AS EXPLAINED ABOVE.

Mappings are configured using properties. See  default namespace in mda/conf/andromda.xml:

	<namespace name="default">
		<properties>
		    ...
		    <!--
			here we configure the mappings to be used,
			we specify the logical names for each mapping
		    -->
		    <property name="languageMappingsUri">Java</property>
		    <property name="wrapperMappingsUri">JavaWrapper</property>
		    <property name="sqlMappingsUri">${sql.mappings}</property>
		    <property name="jdbcMappingsUri">JDBC</property>
		    ...
		</properties>
	</namespace>

The logical names can be found in the mapping file itself, at the top of the file, as shown here: 

    <mappings name="Java">
        ..
        <mapping>
            <from>datatype::String</from>
            <to>java.lang.String</to>
        </mapping>
        ...
    </mappings>


11.1 Customizing the default mappings
-------------------------------------
Overriding:

Change prperties in default namespace (from logical name to URI):

	<property name="languageMappingsUri">file:${maven.src.dir}/mappings/MyJavaMappings.xml</property>
	<property name="wrapperMappingsUri">file:${maven.src.dir}/mappings/MyJavaWrapperMappings.xml</property>
	<property name="jdbcMappingsUri">file:${maven.src.dir}/mappings/MyJdbcMappings.xml</property>
	<property name="sqlMappingsUri">file:${maven.src.dir}/mappings/MySqlMappings.xml</property>


Extending:

	<mappings name="HibernateExtension">
		<extends>Hibernate</extends>
		...
		<mapping>
		    <from>datatype::boolean</from>
		    <from>datatype::Boolean</from>
		    <to>yes_no</to>
		</mapping>
		...
	</mappings>


	????? but where ?????


12. Profiles 
------------
XML configuration file (which is typically located at 

	META-INF/andromda/profile.xml 
	
with a cartridge or metafacade jar) 
allows someone using AndroMDA to map stereotypes, tagged values, and data types to ANY names he or she wants without 
having to change ANY code.

Overriding Profile Values:

- create your own profile mapping, for example mda/conf/mappings/CustomizedProfileMappings.xml:

	<profile>
	    ...
	    <element name="ENTITY">
		<value>entity</value>
	    </element>
	    ...
	</profile>

- you'd then define the location of this mappings file as the namespace property profileMappingsUri 
  (within the mda/conf/andromda.xml file), like we do here (notice that the path must be a URI): 


	<namespace name="default">
	    <properties>
		...
		<property name="profileMappingsUri">file:${basedir}/mda/conf/mappings/CustomizedProfileMappings.xml</property>
		...
	    </properties>
	</namespace>
