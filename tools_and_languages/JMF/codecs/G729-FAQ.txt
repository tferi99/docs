G.729 FAQ
=========

G.729 is an audio data compression algorithm for voice that compresses digital voice in packets of 10 milliseconds
duration. It is officially described as Coding of speech at 8 kbit/s using conjugate-structure algebraic code-excited
linear prediction.

Packets:					1 packet / 10 ms		-> 100 packets/s
Speech sampling rate:		8000 Hz

--------------
The encoder requires raw 16-bit mono PCM speech data sampled at 8000 Hz as input, i.e., without any header
information. For every speech frame, consisting of 80*16 bit (160 bytes) samples, the encoder produces a 10*8
bit (10 bytes) packed parameter list that can be transmitted to the decoder. At the decoder, these parameters are
used to reconstruct the speech data frame in the same format as the encoder input.
The parameter list produced by encoding a frame of audio data is packed into 80 bits (10 bytes). 

With PCM where:
- speech data sampled at 8000 Hz
- Frame rate:	100 packet/s
- 1 packet:		80 sample
- 1 sample:		16 bit
- 1 PCM speech frame 80*16 bit = 160 bytes
- 160 bytes/10 ms	-> 16.000 bytes/s

Decoding:
	
		80 * 16 bit (160 bytes) -> 10 * 8 bit (10 bytes)	=====> ratio:	1/16
