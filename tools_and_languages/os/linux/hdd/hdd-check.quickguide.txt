fsck <device>
		In  actuality,  fsck is simply a front-end for the various
		file system checkers (fsck.fstype) available under  Linux.
		The  file system-specific checker is searched for in /sbin
		first, then in /etc/fs and /etc, and finally in the direc­
		tories  listed  in  the PATH environment variable.  Please
		see the file system-specific checker manual pages for fur­
		ther details.
