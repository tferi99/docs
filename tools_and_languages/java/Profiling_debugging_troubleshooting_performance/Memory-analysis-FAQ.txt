Java Memory basics
================
- Heap memory: 	The heap memory is the runtime data area from which the Java VM allocates memory for ALL CLASS INSTANCES AND ARRAYS.
	
	- Eden Space: The pool from which memory is INITIALLY ALLOCATED for most objects.

	- Survivor Space: The pool containing objects that have SURVIVED THE GARBAGE COLLECTION OF THE EDEN SPACE.

	- Tenured Generation or Old Gen: The pool containing objects that have EXISTED for some time IN THE SURVIVOR SPACE.

- Non-heap memory
	Non-heap memory includes a method area shared among all threads and memory required for the internal processing or 
	optimization for the Java VM. It stores PER-CLASS STRUCTURES such as a 
		- runtime constant pool
		- field and method data
		- the code for methods and constructors
		
	- Permanent Generation: 
		The pool containing all THE REFLECTIVE DATA of the virtual machine itself, such as CLASS AND METHOD OBJECTS. 
		With Java VMs that use class data sharing, this generation is divided into read-only and read-write areas.

	- Code Cache: The HotSpot Java VM also includes a code cache, containing memory that is used for compilation and storage of native code.

Memory analysis basics
======================
- Heap Dump
	A heap dump is a snapshot of the memory of a Java process at a certain point of time. 
	
- Shallow vs. Retained Heap

	- Shallow heap is the memory consumed by one object - WITHOUT references.
	- Retained set of X:	the set of objects which would be removed by GC when X is garbage collected. 
	- Retained heap of X:	the sum of shallow sizes of all objects in the retained set of X, i.e. memory kept alive by X. 

- Dominator Tree

	- An object X dominates an object Y if every path in the object graph from the start (or the root) node to Y must go through X. 
	- The immediate dominator X of some object Y is the dominator closest to the object Y. 
	- A dominator tree is built out of the object graph. In the dominator tree each object is the immediate dominator of its children, 
		so dependencies between the objects are easily identified

How to print memory info of JVM?
================================
jmap -heap <pid>


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
How to create heap dump?
========================

- jmap

	jmap -dump:format=b,file=<filename> <pid>
	
	If it cannot connect to process use -F option. The reality is, the -F switch tells the JVM to use the Serviceability Agent interface for extracting the heap data. 
	THIS ALTERNATE INTERFACE IS EXTREMELY SLOW.
	
	NOTE:
	Dump that takes five minutes without the -F switch might take an hour with the -F switch. So, never use the -F switch, right? 
	There might be a circumstance where the JVM is hung in a way that such that the default interface does not work. If getting the heap dump is critical, 
	then it might be worth trying the -F switch. You would have to balance down-time against the value of understanding the root cause of the problem.
	
	
- jcmd
	
	jcmd <pid> GC.heap_dump <file-path>
	
		Apply -F - simirarly to jmap - if socket cannot be 
	
- JConsole

	- Connect to your JMX enabled instance
	- go to MBeans tab
	- com.sun.management/HotspotDiagnostic/Operations/[dumpHeap]
	- Fill in p0 parameter to name the Heap Dump method, for example:
	
			dumpHeap (p0 /tmp/apas.hprof p1 true)
			
	- press the dumpHeap button

	
- VisualVM

	- Connect to your JMX enabled instance
	- go to Monitor tab
	- press the HeapDump button
	- messagebox notifies end of action
	
	
- HPROF - profiling classes

	java -Xrunhprof[:options] ToBeProfiledClass
	OR
	java -agentlib:hprof=heap=sites ToBeProfiledClass

- on OutOfMemoryError

	Start VM with -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError
	
	If OutOfMemoryError is thrown, VM generates a heap dump.	

	But it requires APPLICATION RESTART.
		
- Eclipse MAT:
	
	ECLIPSE/File/Acquire Heap Dump...
	
  OR
	
	ECLIPSE/File/New/Other.../Other/Heap Dump

	
- programmatically:

	The other way to use the HotSpotDiagnostic MBean is by invoking it programmatically from Java code.

		public static void dumpHeap(String filePath, boolean live) throws IOException {
			MBeanServer server = ManagementFactory.getPlatformMBeanServer();
			HotSpotDiagnosticMXBean mxBean = ManagementFactory.newPlatformMXBeanProxy(
			  server, "com.sun.management:type=HotSpotDiagnostic", HotSpotDiagnosticMXBean.class);
			mxBean.dumpHeap(filePath, live);
		}
		
	Notice that an hprof file cannot be overwritten. If we fail to do so we'll get an exception:

		Exception in thread "main" java.io.IOException: File exists
			at sun.management.HotSpotDiagnostic.dumpHeap0(Native Method)
			at sun.management.HotSpotDiagnostic.dumpHeap(HotSpotDiagnostic.java:60)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
OQL
===
OQL is SQL-like query language to query Java heap. OQL allows to filter/select information wanted from Java heap. While pre-defined queries such as "show all instances of class X" 
are already supported by HAT, OQL adds more flexibility. OQL is based on JavaScript expression language.

!!! OQL in MAT and VisualVM are NOT COMPATIBLE !!!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
MAT OQL
=======
- SELECT:
	- *	: To display objects and be able to browse the outgoing references, use the * symbol
		
		SELECT * FROM java.lang.String
		
	- fields
	
		You can access all properties:
		
			SELECT t.tid, t.threadStatus, t.name.toString(), t.customId FROM INSTANCEOF java.lang.Thread t 
	
		NOTE: result is emty string for non-existing fields

		
	- Important properties (with @ prefix):			[ <alias>. ] @<attribute> ...
	
	

			objectId			: id of snapshot object
			class				: Java class of this object (in MAT)
			clazz				: IClass of this object. See also classof(object).
			usedHeapSize		: shallow heap size
			retainedHeapSize	:	retained heap size
			displayName			: display name
			Class object	IClass	classLoaderId	id of the class loader
			
			For example:
			
				SELECT @objectId, @class, @clazz, classof(t), @usedHeapSize, @retainedHeapSize, @classSpecificName FROM INSTANCEOF java.lang.Thread t 
				
	- Expressions:
	
		SELECT s.@objectId, (s.@objectId * 2), ("The object ID is " + @objectId) FROM OBJECTS 0,1,1,2 s 
		
		
		
- WHERE	
		
	SELECT t.tid, t.threadStatus, t.name.toString(), t.customId FROM INSTANCEOF java.lang.Thread t WHERE (t.threadStatus = 225)

VisualVM OQL
============
VisualVM can access object properties directly:

		select t from org.ftoth.javamemoryleakdemo.thread.TestThread t where /cica/.test(t.tag)


		https://visualvm.github.io/documentation.html

How to log GC activity?	
=======================
- Simple:	to activate “simple” GC Logging add JVM start-up arguments:

	-verbose:gc

	for example with other memory parameters:

		-XX:+UseSerialGC -Xms1024m -Xmx1024m -verbose:gc

	NOTE:
		The important argument here is the -verbose:gc, which activates the logging of garbage collection information in its simplest form. 
		
		By default, the GC log is written to stdout and should output a line for every young generation GC and every full GC.
		For the purposes of our example, we've specified the serial garbage collector, the simplest GC implementation, via the argument -XX:+UseSerialGC

		We've also set a minimal and maximal heap size of 1024mb, but there are, of course, more JVM parameters we can tune.
		
		
	Output:
	
		[GC (Allocation Failure)  279616K->146232K(1013632K), 0.3318607 secs]
		[GC (Allocation Failure)  425848K->295442K(1013632K), 0.4266943 secs]
		[Full GC (System.gc())  434341K->368279K(1013632K), 0.5420611 secs]
		[GC (Allocation Failure)  647895K->368280K(1013632K), 0.0075449 secs]
		
		
			- GC or Full GC:		The type of Garbage Collection, either GC or Full GC to distinguish a minor or full garbage collection.
			
			- (Allocation Failure) or (System.gc()):	The cause of the collection – Allocation Failure indicates that no more space was left in Eden to allocate our objects.
				
			- 279616K->146232K:		The occupied heap memory before and after the GC, respectively (separated by an arrow)
				
			- (1013632K): 			The current capacity of the heap

			- 0.3318607 secs:		The duration of the GC event in seconds		
		
		

- Detailed:	to activate the detailed GC logging, we use the argument 

	-XX:+PrintGCDetails
	
  It provides:
	- Size of the young and old generation before and after each GC
	- The time it takes for a GC to happen in young and old generation
	- The Size of objects promoted at every GC
	- A summary of the size of the total heap	

- Adding Date and Time Information:

	-XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps -XX:+PrintGCDateStamps
	
		OR from Java 9
	
	-Xlog:gc*::time
	
- Logging to a File:

	-Xloggc:/path/to/file/gc.log
	
		OR from Java 9
		
	-Xlog:gc:/path/to/file/gc.log
	
	
- Java 9: Unified JVM Logging:

	Please note that the -XX:+PrintGCDetails flag has been deprecated in Java 9.
	The new equivalent of the -XX:+PrintGCDetails is the -Xlog:gc* option. 


		-Xlog:gc
		-Xlog:gc=debug
		-Xlog:gc=debug:file=gc.txt
		-Xlog:gc=debug::pid,time,uptime

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
GC roots
========
A garbage collection root is an object that is accessible from outside the heap. 
The following reasons make an object a GC root:

- System Class
	Class loaded by bootstrap/system class loader. For example, everything from the rt.jar like java.util.* .
	
- JNI Local
	Local variable in native code, such as user defined JNI code or JVM internal code.
	
- JNI Global
	Global variable in native code, such as user defined JNI code or JVM internal code.
	
- Thread Block
	Object referred to from a currently active thread block.
	
- Thread
	A started, but not stopped, thread.
	
- Busy Monitor
	Everything that has called wait() or notify() or that is synchronized. For example, by calling synchronized(Object) or by entering a synchronized method. Static method means class, non-static method means object.
	
- Java Local
	Local variable. For example, input parameters or locally created objects of methods that are still in the stack of a thread.
	
- Native Stack
	In or out parameters in native code, such as user defined JNI code or JVM internal code. This is often the case as many methods have native parts and the objects handled as method parameters become GC roots. For example, parameters used for file/network I/O methods or reflection.
	
- Finalizable
	An object which is in a queue awaiting its finalizer to be run.
	
- Unfinalized
	An object which has a finalize method, but has not been finalized and is not yet on the finalizer queue.
	
- Unreachable
	An object which is unreachable from any other root, but has been marked as a root by MAT to retain objects which otherwise would not be included in the analysis.
	
- Java Stack Frame
	A Java stack frame, holding local variables. Only generated when the dump is parsed with the preference set to treat Java stack frames as objects.
	
- Unknown
	An object of unknown root type. Some dumps, such as IBM Portable Heap Dump files, do not have root information. For these dumps the MAT parser marks objects which are have no inbound references or are unreachable from any other root as roots of this type. This ensures that MAT retains all the objects in the dump.

Thread analysis
===============
- Thread states can be retieved by 

			State java.lang.Thread.getState()
				
	- where State is:			Enum Thread.State
	
			NEW				: A thread that has not yet started is in this state.
			RUNNABLE		: A thread executing in the Java virtual machine is in this state.
			BLOCKED			: A thread that is blocked waiting for a monitor lock is in this state.
			WAITING			: A thread that is waiting indefinitely for another thread to perform a particular action is in this state.
			TIMED_WAITING	: A thread that is waiting for another thread to perform an action for up to a specified waiting time is in this state.
			TERMINATED		: A thread that has exited is in this state.

	- but in memory state is stored into bits of an integer value:
	
			private volatile int threadStatus
	
	- and converted into Thread.State enum with:
		
			sun.misc.VM.toThreadState(threadStatus)
		

			public static Thread.State toThreadState(int threadStatus) {
				if ((threadStatus & JVMTI_THREAD_STATE_RUNNABLE) != 0) {

- call Gear icon for Thread report
	- it can be filtered by any field with regex, for example:	
	
		- get terminated threads:								.*terminated.*				(or simply 'terminated' - .* will be addded automatically 
		- get not-terminated threads:							^((?!terminated).)*$
		
		NOTE:	Unfortunately you cannot create a histogram from filtered thread report - histogram is not filtered (see OQL solution)
		
	- you can get number of entries at the end of list
	
		- if you want to watch all entries right-click on bottom total line + Expand All
		
	- OQL:
		
		- get all threads:
		
			SELECT objects t FROM INSTANCEOF java.lang.Thread t
		
		- get terminated threads:

			SELECT objects t FROM INSTANCEOF java.lang.Thread t
			WHERE t.threadStatus = 2
		
		- get not-terminated thread:
		
			SELECT objects t FROM INSTANCEOF java.lang.Thread t
			WHERE t.threadStatus != 2
		
		NOTE:	fortunately flag 2 used only for 'Terminated' status and not combined with other flags (I hope so :| ).
		
		- create a histogram from OQL result

	https://www.baeldung.com/jvm-garbage-collectors

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
How to specify GC type used by JVM?
===================================
1. Serial Garbage Collector

	-XX:+UseSerialGC
	
	- It basically designed for a SINGLE THREAD ENVIRONMENT, NOT FOR SERVERS.
	- This GC implementation freezes all application threads when it runs. 
	- It uses single thread for garbage collection.
	
2. Parallel Garbage Collector
		
	- This uses multiple threads for garbage collection. 
	- Similar to serial garbage collector this also freezes all the application threads while performing garbage collection. 
	- The garbage collector is suited best for those applications THAT CAN BEAR APPLICATION PAUSES.
		
	-XX:+UseParallelGC
	-XX:ParallelGCThreads=<N>
	-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=<N>
	-XX:GCTimeRatio=<N>
		
		
		Default in Java 8.

3. CMS Garbage Collector

	-XX:+USeParNewGC

	- Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS) garbage collector uses multiple garbage collector threads for garbage collection. 
	- It scans the heap memory to mark instances for eviction and then sweep the marked instances. 
	- It’s designed for applications THAT PREFER SHORTER GARBAGE COLLECTION PAUSES, and that can afford to share processor resources with the garbage collector while the application is running.
	- In comparison with the parallel garbage collector, CMS COLLECTOR USES MORE CPU to ensure better application throughput. I
	
4. G1 Garbage Collector

	 -XX:+UseG1GC
	 
	 - G1 collector will replace the CMS collector since it’s more performance efficient.
	 
5. Epsilon Garbage Collector

	-XX:+UseEpsilonGC 

	- Epsilon is a non-operational or a passive garbage collector. 
	- It allocates the memory for the application, but it doesn’t collect the unused objects. 	 
	- The purpose of this garbage collector is MEASURING AND MANAGING APPLICATION PERFORMANCE.  
	
6. Z garbage collector

	- Oracle introduced ZGC in Java 11.
	- ZGC performs all expensive work concurrently, without stopping the execution of application threads for more than 10ms, 
		which makes it suitable for applications THAT REQUIRE LOW LATENCY AND/OR USE A VERY LARGE HEAP.
	- The Z garbage collector performs its cycles in its threads. It pauses the application for an average of 1 ms. 
		The G1 and Parallel collectors average roughly 200 ms.

	
7. Shenandoah

	+UseShenanodoahC

	- Shenandoah is an ultra-low pause time garbage collector that reduces GC pause times by performing more garbage collection work 
		concurrently with the running Java program.

How to elminate string duplications?
====================================
How does it work?
	If you have a String whose content already contained by other String it will be checked if this object 
	survives N GC run. 
	Then its char[] will be replaced by reference to existing char[].


- use: 	-XX:+UseStringDeduplication

- works Only With the G1 GC Algorithm
