Method parameters
-----------------
When a resource method is invoked, parameters annotated with one of the extractor annotations
seen previously are filled. 
The value of a nonannotated parameter (called an ENTITY PARAMETER) is mapped
from the request entity body and converted by an ENTITY PROVIDER.

Methods may return void, Response, or another Java type. Response is used when additional
metadata needs to be provided; for example, when you create a new customer, you might need to send
back the URI of this customer.
