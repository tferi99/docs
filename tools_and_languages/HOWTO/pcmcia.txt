Installing and configuring PCMCIA on SuSE Linux  for Xybernaut MA IV
====================================================================

- query pcmcia package with rpm, if not installed you have to install it first
(read /usr/dor/howto/../PCMCIA... about necessary kernel settings)
- query type of PCMCIA card with 'probe' or 'probe -m'
  MAIV conatins a i82365 compatible Ricoh card
- generally you can start pcmcia service with starter script 
  (/etc/rc.d/pcmcia start)
- present time I can't start PCMCIA automatically. If I try it it hangs 
  up OS. I start my starter script manually instead (start_pcmcia). 

  probe -m         # only displaying type of card
  insmod /lib/modules/2.2.13/pcmcia/pcmcia_core.o       # general core module
  insmod /lib/modules/2.2.13/pcmcia/i82365.o irq_mode=1 setup_time=3 cmd_time=6 hold_time=1       # module for i82365 card with settings
  insmod /lib/modules/2.2.13/pcmcia/ds.o
  cardmgr    # card manager

  I found necessary settings for i82365.o with Ricoh card in 'man i82365'.

  However, this script contains the same commands, it works. I tried to start
  PCMCIA automatically during startup, I set variables in /etc/rc.config:

  !!! If it doesn't work, try to plug in card to another slot !!!
  
  START_PCMCIA="yes"
  PCMCIA="i82365"		# type of card
  PCMCIA_PCIC_OPTS="irq_mode=1 setup_time=3 cmd_time=6 hold_time=1"

  By this settings run same commands contained my start_pcmcia script, but it 
  doesn't work. I don't know yet why.

  Whether PCMCIA base modules started properly you can check with
	 cat /proc/devices
  It has to contain pcmcia entry.

- /etc/pcmcia contains scripts for starting specific services. 
  *.opts files contain options for scripts, we have to edit them. For 
  example I had to set IPADDR and BROADCAST values and call

  	/etc/pcmcia/network start eth0

  to start network service on eth0. We don't need additional settings, 
  this script starts all of necessary commands (ifconfig, route, ...). 
  It's a similar script as /etc/rc.d/network.
