All registry settings for Windows File Protection/System File Checker
are located in the following registry key:

HKEY LOCAL MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon

MORE INFORMATION
By default, only users with Administrator or System rights can modify
these settings.

Registry Values
SFCDisable (REG DWORD)
0 = enabled (default)
1 = disabled, prompt at boot to re-enable
2 = disabled at next boot only, no prompt to re-enable
4 = enabled, with popups disabled

NOTE: For options 1 and 2: Both of these options require a kernel
debugger to be hooked up for those options to become useable. If a
kernel debugger is not hooked up, Windows File Protection is not
disabled.
SFCScan (REG DWORD)
0 = do not scan protected files at boot (default)
1 = scan protected files at every boot
2 = scan protected files once
SFCQuota (REG DWORD)
n = size (in megabytes) of dllcache quota (default is 0xffffffff or
approximately 300 MB)
FFFFFFFF = cache all protected system files on the local hard disk
SFCDllCacheDir (REG EXPAND SZ)
Path = local or network location of dllcache folder (default is
%SystemRoot%\System32)

NOTE: Network shares for the dllcache directory are no longer supported.

SFCShowProgress (REG DWORD)
0 = System File Checker progress meter is not displayed (default)
1 = System File Checker progress meter is displayed

NOTE: The Windows 2000 source files location information is stored in
the following registry location and can be modified to point to the
drive letter of a volume that has an I386 flat folder of the
installation files
 
HKEY LOCAL MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Setup\Source
Path:REG SZ:<drive letter>:

  and

  HKEY LOCAL MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\WindowsNT\
	CurrentVersion\SourcePath:REG SZ:<drive letter>:

where drive letter is the appropriate drive letter.

Example:

If the I386 directory is at C:\I386, the SourcePath value would be C:\.

If the I386 directory is at E:\Directory\I386, the SourcePath value
would be E:\Directory.

After you restart the computer, WFP and SFC /SCANNOW uses the new source
path instead of prompting for the Windows 2000 installation CD-ROM.
