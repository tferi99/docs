Kernel linking:

1. cd /usr/src/linux (...)

You can find default kernel parameters in .config file using by 'make config'.

2. make config (or make xconfig from X)
3. make dep
4. make clean
5. make bzImage

'make' will display where the new kernel will be created.

Copy the new kernel into /boot in a different name then current kernel.
Make a new entry in /etc/lilo.conf to make possible to start new kernel.
After then you have to call
		lilo
, to reinstall LILO by the new lilo.conf .
!!! It's important, because a checksum will be generated about kernels by lilo.

6. If you have configured some parts as modules, you have to compile these
   modules as well by entering:
   		make modules
7. To install modules into the appropriate directory:
		make modules_install

		
8. You can clean disk after conpilation by entering:
		make clean
		
   in /usr/src/linux directory.
