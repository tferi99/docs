Using BIND (DNS)
================

Tracing of resolving DNS names
-----c-------------------------

Get DNS result in non-recursive mode step by step bouncing through DNS servers.
First issue:

		dig +norec +noques +nostats +nocmd <host name>

This will get DNS information for specified host from your DNS server. 
If this lists contains an 'ANSWER SECTION', there will you found the desired address.
Otherwise you have to bounce to another server listed in 'AUTHORITY SECTION'.

		dig +norec +noques +nostats +nocmd <host name> @<another server from aut-sect>


You have to repeate this until an 'ANSWER SECTION' has been provided.




Dumping server data
-------------------

Send SIGINT to named. It will create named_dump.db file in named working directory.

(/var/named or /var/tmp or /var/tmp/named).


It contains cached entries as well, so you have restart named to get your own entries.
