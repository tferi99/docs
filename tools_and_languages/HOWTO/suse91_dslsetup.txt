SuSE 9.1 DSL setup
==================

The easiest way to setup DSL is using Yast.

1. Choose a LAN card to connect ADSL modem.

2. Set a static IP address for this interface. For example: 192.168.2.1/255.255.255.0.
   It's only a placeholder for new interface.
   DON'T SET DEFAULT GATEWAY.

3. Connect and switch ON ADSL modem.

4. Call Yast to create new DSL interface (Network devices/DSL menu)

	- Add new DSL device
		PPP mode		: PPP over Ethernet
		Ethernet card		: choose one from combo box (to identify see files in /etc/sysconfig/network)
		Device acivation	: On Boot

5. Restart network and smpppd if necessary:
	- rcnetwork restart
	- rcsmpppd restart

6. rcsmpppd commands

	- getting DSL interface:		cinternet -I

		Example output:
				
				01 i dsl0

	- getting state of a DLS interface:	cinternet -i dsl0 -s [-v]

	- starting interface:			cinternet -i dsl0 -A

	- stopping interface:			cinternet -i dsl0 -O

	After starting you have to see a new network interface:		ppp0

	See:  
		man smpppd
		man cinternet
