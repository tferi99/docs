X11 forwarding through SSH
==========================

- Install X Server (Cygwin/X, Xming)

- Login into remote machine using SSH


	You can run remote X application on your local X server in secure mode. 
	Yuo have to call X through SSH client.
	
	Command line:

		ssh -X -C -l <user> <host>

		-X : enabling X forwarding
		-C : enabling compression (recommended for slow connection)
	
	PuTTY:
		Enable X11 forwarding:
			- Connection/SSH/X11/[X11 forwarding]
				- Enable X11 forwarding	: 	set
				- X display location:		localhost:0
		
	
	
	This SSH connection will forward your local X server port to remote machine.
	SSH daemon will set DISPLAY environment variable, so X applications will
	find X server.

- To establish X11 forward (maybe) XAUTH has to be installed on the remote (X client) side.

- On caller side you should authorize remote client with xhost.


Troubleshooting
---------------
- Check X server port. 

	port = 6000 + display_index

- 	Sometimes you get this message during SSH connection (e.g. in PuTTY event log):

		No xauth program, cannot forward ...
	
	'xauth' not installed on remote side. In this case DISPLAY won't be set during connection. Install 'xauth' into remote side.	
	
- Cannot open display (on client)
	Display not specified neither in command line nor in DISPLAY environment variable.
	
	If application knows '-display' or '--display', use it, e.g:

		wireshark --display=192.168.5.113:0
		
	or set environment variable:
	
		export DISPLAY=192.168.5.113:0
	
- Xlib: No protocol specified

	 Sometimes you cannot connect to the local X server, e.g. after su to another
	 user. In this situation you have to add local host to X access control list:

	Cygwin/X or linux:
	 
		xhost + [<host>]			: access to a host 
		
		xhost +						: access to anybody - NOT SECURE!!!
	
	Xming:
	
		Call xming with -ac
