================================

depmod -a		: looking for devices with unresolved symbols 
depmod -e		: -a + it shows unresolved symbols
depmod -n		: it writes dependency tree to standard output

by modprobe to load t load modules or stack of modules automatically.


insmod 			: it installs a loadable kernel into running kernel
