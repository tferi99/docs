FTP active/passive modes
========================

Active mode
-----------

1. Client try to connect to port 21 of server, and opens a "server" on port N, where N > 1024.

Passive mode

Notes for ipchains MASQ
-----------------------
If you wants to connect to a server with active mode from behind a ipchains firewall, you have to load ip_masq_ftp. This module will translate port value N used by server to connect from port 20, because port N of client is masqued, so server can't connect to it in normal way. This module changes address sent by client in first FTP connect.
