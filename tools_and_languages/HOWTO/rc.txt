How can you start a program automatically during system init/cleanup ?

For more about  run level changing (and starting/cleanup) read man page of 'init'.

On starting/stopping init calls /sbin/init.d/rc with the new running level as parameter (see /etc/inittab).
For every run level there are scripts that called automatically during staring/stopping Linux. These scripts are in /etc/rc.d/rcN.d (symlink to /sbin/init.d), where N is the desired runlevel.

If you would like to call a program automatically on a given runlevel starting, you simply have to put a script into the appropriate directory. With the name of script you have to follow the following convention:

	S|K<N><name>

	- S : starting script, K : script called by shutting down
	- N : specifies the calling order of several scripts
	- name : an arbitrary name to specify the function of this script

	For example:
		S123Something, K155MyServer
