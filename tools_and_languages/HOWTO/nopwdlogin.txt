How to login into desktop linux without password?
=================================================

1. LILO
	Get names of bootable systems by pressing TAB.
	a. boot: <name> S
	b. boot: <name> single

	Some system may ask for root password for single user mode (e.g. SuSe 6.3)
  
	b. boot: <name> init=/bin/bash

To prevent your linux from logging in by anybody through LILO, do the followings:
	a. Set permissions of /etc/lilo.conf to 600.
	b. Put the following lines into /etc/lilo.conf:
			restricted
			password=<password>

	c. Call lilo.


2. With boot disk:
	a. Boot you system from a linux boot disk (with recovery floppy FS).
	b. Mount your harddisk.



If you cannot write some files on your / FS, because the filesystem was mounted in readonly mode, you can remount it:

	mount -n -w -o remount /
