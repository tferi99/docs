How to write LSB-compliant Linux Standard Base) startup scripts?
================================================================

LSB-compliant init scripts need to:

- provide - at least - the following actions: 
	start, stop, restart, force-reload, and status. 
	
	All of those, except for status, are required by the Debian Policy, chapter 9.3.2 Writing the scripts. "Status" support has been requested into policy, see #291148 and LSBInitScripts/StatusSupport.
	
- return proper exit status codes

- document runtime dependencies

- [optionally] Log messages using the Init.d functions: log_success_msg, log_failure_msg and log_warning_msg 
	(This would introduce consistent output in scripts, as requested in http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg00729.html
	
This metadata information should be in the following format:

	### BEGIN INIT INFO
	# Provides:          scriptname
	# Required-Start:    $remote_fs $syslog
	# Required-Stop:     $remote_fs $syslog
	# Default-Start:     2 3 4 5
	# Default-Stop:      0 1 6
	# Short-Description: Start daemon at boot time
	# Description:       Enable service provided by daemon.
	### END INIT INFO
