Howto tokenize in bash?
=======================

Bash has a variable IFS (Internal Field Separator), that contains separator characters, which are used by identifying fields in a string.

You can change it (it's preferable to save it before changing). For example listing fields of PATH variable:

OLDIFS=$IFS
IFS=":"
for i in $PATH
do
	echo $i
done

	man bash
