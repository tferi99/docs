Using SuSE 8.1 without any mouse
--------------------------------

The problem is: SuSE 8.1 always scans for hardware at boot time, and there isn't any mouse 
plugged into the box, it call yast2, and boot process is interrupted.

Solution:
	Edit /usr/sbin/hwbootscan, and comment mouse section.

		#neededchanged=`/usr/sbin/hwscan --mouse`
		#if [ -n "$neededchanged" ] ; then
		#   /sbin/yast2 mouse reprobe
		#fi
