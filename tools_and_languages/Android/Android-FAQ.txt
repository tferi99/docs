Errormessage: unknown virtual device name
=========================================
I installed all the prerequisites for Android development. I created a virtual device through Eclipse and tried to run the 
Hello World sample application in that device. I received the following error message.

	emulator: ERROR: unknown virtual device name: 'Android21Device'
	emulator: could not find virtual device named 'Android21Device'

I get the same error when I try to start the device from the command line and through the SDK program.

I can see the device directory and files at 

D:\Users\anthony\.android\avd\Android21Device.avd


Possible workrounds:
1. First, you can create a directory hard-link (or junction) from the system drive android folder to the one in your user profile. 
In Windows 7, you can use the following command

	mklink /J C:\Users\anthony\.android D:\Users\anthony\.android
	
The Android SDK Manager and emulator can use an environment variable ANDROID_SDK_HOME to identify the location of the .android directory. 
Set a user or environment variable:

	ANDROID_SDK_HOME = 'D:\Users\anthony'
