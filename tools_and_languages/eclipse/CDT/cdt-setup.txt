CDT is C/C++ Development Toolkit under Eclipse.

1. Necessary components
-----------------------
- Eclipse 3.3 (Europe) with CDT
- Cygwin

2. Setup of components
----------------------
2.1 Eclipse
-----------
Method 2:
	Download 'Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers' from :

		http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
		
Method 2:
	If you already have an Eclipse Europe without CDT intalled, 
	you can update components using Eclipse Update function.:
	
		- Call menu 'Help/Software Updates/Find and Install...'.

		- Search for new features to install

		- Button 'New Remote Site...'

		- Name: CDT

				URL:	http://download.eclipse.org/tools/cdt/releases/europa

		 - Button 'Finish' and follow instuctions.
		
2.2 Cygwin
----------
Cygwin is a Linux-like environment for Windows. It consists of two parts: 
	- A DLL (cygwin1.dll) which acts as a Linux API emulation layer providing substantial Linux API functionality. 
	- A collection of tools which provide Linux look and feel.

- Download:			http://cygwin.com/setup.exe

- Start setup.exe

- You can install components from Internet or you can download the whole stuff into hard drive for offline installation.

- Root directory:	

		C:\cygwin
		
	WARNING: Don't install cygwin under location where path contains spaces (e.g. Program Files). Maybe works, 
			but sometimes may not.
			
- Choose a fast (hungarian) mirror

- Choose packages from 'Select Packages' list

	- If you leave default settings you will get core Cygwin with base tools
	- For CDT you have to choose the following additional packages:
		- Devel/gcc-core: C compiler
		- Devel/make: The GNU version of the 'make' utility 
		- Devel/gdb: The GNU Debugger
	
	
3. Settings
-----------
- To access Cygwin DLL add 
	
	c:\cygwin\bin 
	
	to PATH environment variable.
	
- In case of this error message:
	
	Can't find a source file at "/cygdrive/......" 
	Locate the file or edit the source lookup path to include its location.

	If you're working under Windows, have you set the required mappings?
	Maybe Eclipse couldn't find the Source because of the missing mapping to
	the (cygwin-)drive where your projects/workspaces are.
	
	For example you project is in drive D:
	
	- Windows/Preferences/C/C++/Debug/Common Source Lookup
	- Add a new Path Mapping:  click [Add] => Path Mapping => [OK]
	- Select the new Mapping => [Edith] => change Name of Mapping "Project Source" 
	- [Add]
	- set "Compilation path" to the Source /cygdrive/d
	- set "Local file system path" tho d:\

	
4. Troubleshooting
------------------
Problem: WinCVS doesn't work after adding Cygwin to PATH. 
 
	If you add Cygwin to path environment variable you cannot use WinCVS,
	because tcl84.dll from Cygwin and WinCVS are incompatible. You cannot 
	rename tcl84.dll in Cygwin because it's used by GDB.
	
Solution: 

	Call Eclipse through a BAT, like this:
	
		set PATH=%PATH%;C:\cygwin\bin
		C:\eclipse-jee-europa\eclipse.exe

		
	
Problem:	org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.launching.GDBDebugger cannot be cast to org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core.ICDebugger

Solution: choose a debugger under debugger configuration (Debug tab)
