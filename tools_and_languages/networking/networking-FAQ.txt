How traceroute does work?
=========================
Traceroute works by increasing the "time-to-live" value of each successive batch of packets sent. 
The first three packets sent have a time-to-live (TTL) value of one (implying that they are not forwarded by the next router and make only a single hop). 
The next three packets have a TTL value of 2, and so on. 

When a packet passes through a host, normally the host decrements the TTL value by one, and forwards the packet to the next host. 
When a packet with a TTL of one reaches a host, the host discards the packet and sends an ICMP time exceeded (type 11) packet to the sender. 
The traceroute utility uses these returning packets to produce a list of hosts that the packets have traversed en route to the destination. 
The three timestamp values returned for each host along the path are the delay (aka latency) values typically in milliseconds (ms) 
for each packet in the batch. If a packet does not return within the expected timeout window, a star (asterisk) is traditionally printed. 

Traceroute may not list the real hosts. It indicates that the first host is at one hop, the second host at two hops, etc. 
IP does not guarantee that all the packets take the same route. Also note that if the host at hop number N does not reply, the hop will be skipped in the output.

Unix:
	On modern Unix and Linux-based operating systems, the traceroute utility by default uses UDP datagrams with destination ports number from 33434 to 33534. 
Windows:	
	The traceroute utility usually has an option to specify use of ICMP echo request (type 8) instead, as used by the Windows tracert utility. 
	
If you have a firewall and if you want traceroute to work from both machines (Unix/Linux and Windows) you will need to allow both protocols inbound 
through your firewall (UDP with ports from 33434 to 33534 and ICMP type 8).

There are also traceroute implementations that use TCP packets, such as tcptraceroute or Layer Four Trace. pathping is a utility introduced with 
Windows NT that combines ping and traceroute functionality. mtr (My traceroute) is an enhanced version of ICMP traceroute which is available for 
Unix and Windows systems. All implementations of traceroute rely on ICMP (type 11) packets being sent to the originator.
