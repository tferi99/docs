"Class has two properties of the same name" issue
=================================================
When I added this before a field in a class, e.g.:

	@XmlElement(required=true)
	private String action;

and then ran wsgen to generate the web service, it would always fail with
Caused by: com.sun.xml.bind.v2.runtime.IllegalAnnotationsException:
1 counts of IllegalAnnotationExceptions
Class has two properties of the same name "action"

However, if you move the annotation to the getter method, e.g.

	@XmlElement(required=true)
	public String getAction() {
		return action;
	}

it works fine.

In short, the answer is that unless you specify it, the XmlAccessorType will default to PUBLIC_MEMBER, which will cause JAXB 
to bind public fields and public getter/setters. So a private instance variable won’t be bound unless you change the default 
using @XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.FIELD) on the class. Not sure if I understand the message though - how come wsgen reports
 two properties with the same name in this case? - but this is a workaround anyway.
