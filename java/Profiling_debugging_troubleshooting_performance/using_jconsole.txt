The JConsole Tool
-----------------
JConsole is a JMX-compliant GUI tool that connects to a running JVM, which started with the management agent. 
To start an application with the management agent for local monitoring, set the 

	com.sun.management.jmxremote 
	
system property when you start the application. For example, to enable the J2SE sample application 
Java2Demo for local monitoring, enter the following command:

   JDK_HOME/bin/java -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote -jar JDK_HOME/demo/jfc/Java2D/Java2Demo.jar

where JDK_HOME is the directory containing the JDK 5.0. The Monitoring and Management Using JMX document provides 
detailed information on out-of-the-box remote management. 

To start JConsole, run

   JDK_HOME/bin/jconsole
   
   
Using plugins:
- download plugin JAR
- copy next to executable
- run with plugin. e.g.:

	jconsole -pluginpath topthreads-1.1.jar
