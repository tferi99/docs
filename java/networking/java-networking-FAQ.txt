URL Decoding/Encoding in Java and JavaScript
============================================

Here is the tip if you are working on URL decoding/encoding on both the server side using java and on
client side using javascript.

In JAVA,

	We use java.net.URLEncoder and java.net.URLDecoder to encode/decode strings.

In JAVASCRIPT,

	We use encodeURIComponent and deodeURIComponent to do the same thing.

BUT, there is one big difference b/w the java and javascript encode/decode logic.

Java version encodes the space character as + while the javascript version encodes it as %20 
(hex equivalent of space char).

So if you are encoding anything on server side and trying to decode it in javascript than you will 
need to replace + manually before considering URL properly decoded. For example,

	function decodeURIComponent(decodedTxt)
	{
		// first we replace any + chars with single space as javascript built in functions do not 
		replace + with space character
		var tempTxt = decodedTxt.replace(/\+/g, ' ');
		return decodeURIComponent(tempTxt);
	}
