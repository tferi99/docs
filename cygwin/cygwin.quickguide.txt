Sending mail
============
Install ssmtp (e.g. with a mail client: mutt, pine)

See also:
	/usr/share/doc/Cygwin/ssmtp-*.README


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Documentations
==============
- /usr/shar/doc/*
- /usr/shar/doc/Cygwin/*


Installing cygserver
====================
Newer versions of Cygwin provide IPC functions by cygserver (see above).

At the first call initalize Cyserver:

	cygserver-config

This can install Cygserver as service. Start Cyserver before starting Postgres.

The Cygserver services are used by Cygwin applications only if you set the environment
variable CYGWIN to contain the string "server". You must do this before
starting the application.

	export CYGWIN=server

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installing sshd
===============
Call:
	
	ssh-host-config -y
	
	(run as administrator)

Should privilege separation be used? (yes/no)

	Privilege separation is a technique to make the sshd service more secure. 
	Privilege separation splits the sshd service in two computer processes, 
	one process runs as "root" (SYSTEM) and the other process runs as a lower-privileged user account, 
	typically this account is created as a user called "sshd".

	This technique makes the pre-authentication attack on the system much harder.

Do you want to install sshd as service? yes

When the script stops and asks you for "environment variable CYGWIN=" your answer is 

	ntsec tty

	ntsec is an environment variable used by cygwin to instruct cygwin to use Windows' 
	security rules for controlling users' access to files and other operating system facilities.
	
	tty is an environment variable used by cygwin to make it work properly with editors
	such as pico and nano

	Without it (the default case), you won't be able to insert characters.	
	
To start:
	
	cygrunsrv -S sshd	

	It starts:		/usr/sbin/sshd -D
	
Troubleshouting:

	/usr/sbin/sshd -D -dd
	
Fixing some problems:

Segmentation fault during ssh-host-config
-----------------------------------------
ssh-keygen drops segmantation fault during ssh-host-config.

Steps:
	- Run Cygwin as Administrator
	- There are 4 ssh-keygen, run these 4 commands again manually
	- Set owner of generated key pairs to SYSTEM:Administrators
	- Copy generated keypairs into /etc
	- run again ssh-host-config
