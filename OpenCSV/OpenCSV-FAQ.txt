Mapping strategies
==================
HeaderColumnNameMappingStrategy
-------------------------------
It's an interface to define the mapping between the data being written to the header of the CSV. 

- Reading CSV:
	It allows to map CVS file columns to bean fields based on custom name.
	
- Writing CSV:
	When writing bean to CSV this allows to change column header name but we have no control on column order.

If you have an annotataed 
By default this strategy contains header names in CAPITAL and ordered ALPHABETICALLY.



	
ColumnPositionMappingStrategy
-----------------------------
This is defining how to map the field values from CSV row (String[]) to the properties of your JavaBean.

	ColumnPositionMappingStrategy strat = new ColumnPositionMappingStrategy(); 
	strat.setType(YourOrderBean.class); 
	String[] columns = new String[] {"name", "orderNumber", "id"}; // the fields to bind do in your JavaBean 
	strat.setColumnMapping(columns); 
	CsvToBean csv = new CsvToBean(); 
	List list = csv.parse(strat, yourReader);

The key points to note about this class are:
	- Use a public noargs constructor; this is default in Java so no constructor needs to be specified.
	- All properties are private.
	- All properties have getters, i.e. methods called getXxxx that return their value.
	- All properties have setter, i.e. methods called setXxxx that set their value.		
	
- Reading CSV:
	It allows to map CSV file columns to bean fields based on column ordering.

- Writing CSV:
	When writing bean to CSV we can control column order but we get an empty header (implementation returns new String[0] as a header)
	
HeaderColumnNameTranslateMappingStrategy
----------------------------------------
Expands on HeaderColumnNameMappingStrategy by allowing the user to pass in a map of column names to bean names. 
This way the fields in the bean do not have to match the fields in the CSV file. 

This is only for when the user passes in the header names programmatically, and not for annotated beans.

How to customize separator-, quote- and escape-characters for during CSV?
=========================================================================
The maximum possible signature of the constructor is:

	public CSVWriter(Writer writer, char separator, char quotechar, char escapechar)
