Adding Oracle database URL
--------------------------

Database pilot (DbPilot.exe, DbPilotW.exe) reads 

	bin\dbpilot.config 

file to initialize itself during startup.


You have add database driver package to classpath of application with an
entry in config file, for example:

	addpath c:\Oracle\Ora81\jdbc\lib\classes111.zip 


Then add a new URL:

--> File/New

You can choose Oracle driver from list (oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver).

NOTE:
	If databse driver is visible for database pilot it will be displayed in 
	driver list in black (invisible drivers are in red). 

When the Oracle driver is selected in the Driver box, the Browse button next to the 
URL box will be enabled to help you construct an URL, as well as to build "thin" URLs. 
If JBuilder is able to find the Oracle file tnsnames.ora, you can browse to and select 
Oracle data sources. 
If JBuilder is unable to locate the tnsnames.ora file, then no Oracle databases 
will be available to browse. If you know the location of the tnsnames.ora file and 
JBuilder is unable to find it, you can explicitly specify the location 
of the file by adding the following line 
to the dbpilot.config file: 

	jbuilder.datapilot.tnsnames=<fully qualified filename of tnsnames.ora>

for example, 

	jbuilder.datapilot.tnsnames=//usr//orant//net80//admin//tnsnames.ora


Or see 'Oracle Setup' tab in View/Options.


You can choose 'thin' or OCI driver (NOTE: OCI was tested by me, and worked well :)
