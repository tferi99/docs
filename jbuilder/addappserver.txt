How to add new serlet based application server to JBuilder:

1. Install application server
2. Add a new server entry to JBuilder
	- Under menu Tools/Configure servers... 'Copy' button
	  This will create new files in your "C:\Documents and Settings\$USER\.jbuilder9" directory:
		1. <servername>.library
		2. <servername> Servlet.library
	  These files will appear in menu Tools/Configure Libraries... in "User Home" section

3. Add the necessary JARs to server entry in Tools/Configure Libraries... (Class tab)
	For example Tomcat 4.1 has <fullpath>/servlet.jar, but Tomcat 5.x need other JARs (Servlet-api.jar, Jsp-api.jar)

   There isn't direct reference to Servlet API JARs in Servlet entry of 'Configure Libraries...', only a link to 
   server entry (See 'Required Libraries tab of Servlet entry in Project section).
   This entries will provide automatic servlet API change when you change server in project settings.
