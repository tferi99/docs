Containing box
--------------
The containing block for any other element box is determined by the value of the
position property for that element.

position: static (the default) or relative
	Containing block is formed by the edge of the content box of the nearest ancestor
	element whose display property value is one of:
		- block
		- inline-block
		- list-item
		- run-in 
		- table
		- table-cell
	
position: absolute
	Containing block is the nearest positioned ancestor.
	In other words, the nearest ancestor whose position property:
		- absolute
		- fixed
		- relative. 
		
	The containing block is formed by the padding edge of that ancestor.
	
position: fixed
	Containing block is the viewport for continuous media) or the page box (for paged media).
