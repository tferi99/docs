HTML CODING CONVENTIONS MINI
============================

- Split tags written by JS document.write(), e.g.:

	document.write("<src" + "ript .......">);
	
- Add 'alt' property to <img> tag.

- Add TYPE property to <script> and <style> tags, e.g:

	<script type="text/javascript">
	<style type="text/css">

- Authors should avoid using strings such as "</P>" in their embedded scripts. In JavaScript, 
authors may use a backslash to prevent the string from being parsed as markup:

	<script type="text/javascript">
	<!--
	document.write("<\/P>");
	// -->
	</script>	

- In a DOCTYPE, the formal public identifier--the quoted string that appears after the PUBLIC keyword--is case sensitive. 
A common error is to use the following:

	<!doctype html public "-//w3c//dtd html 4.0 transitional//en">

Here the formal public identifier (FPI) is all lowercase. The validator does not recognize the document as HTML 4.0 
Transitional since the expected FPI for HTML 4.0 Transitional uses different case:

	<!doctype html public "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN">	
	
- ID and name attributes must begin with a letter, not a digit.
