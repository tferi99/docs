1. What is brach?
-----------------
CVS allows you to isolate changes onto a separate line of development, known as a branch. 
When you change files on a branch, those changes do not appear on the main trunk or other branches.


2. Adding branch
----------------
You can branch a single file, any group of files, or a whole project just as you can tag individual 
files or any group of them. I USUALLY RECOMMEND BRANCHING A PROJECT.

1. Select the top level directory of the project.
2. Call Remote/Create a branch... menu
3. Specify a name
4. OK


3. Working with brach
---------------------
To work with a branch you have to check out it into a separeted location.

1. Remote/Checkout module...
2. Set CVSROOT, module name and destination location.
3. Set update option 'By revision/tag/brach' (in the 2nd tab) to name of branch.
4. OK

NOTE: CVS directories will contain an additional Tag file with the name of the branch.


4. Merging from a Branch
------------------------
When you are satisfied with the changes you have done on a branch, you may want those changes to be available 
on the main line of development. 
To merge from a branch, do the following: 

1. Select the top level directory of the project. 
2. Click the right mouse button on the selction, and choose the Update selection menu item. 
3. Make sure Create missing directories that exist in the repository is checked. 
4. Select the Merge options tab. 
5. Click the Only this rev./tag radio button. 
6. In the Only this rev./tag input field, enter the tag name of the branch you want to merge from. 
	If you want to merge from a given timestamp in this tag, check the Date radio button and type 
	in your preferred timestamp as well. 
7. Press the OK button.

NOTE: You can only merge only ONCE this way! See more in next chapter.


5. How to merge from a branch several times?
--------------------------------------------
The merge given above will try to merge changes FROM THE START OF THE BRANCH. If you do the 
operation a second time (to merge changes done to the branch after the last merge), merging from 
the start of the branch is not what you want, and it will most likely get you into trouble. 
To get around this problem:

1. ALWAYS give a new tag (e.g. mergeN, or merge-YYYYMMDD) to the branch BEFORE merging.
2. Choose 'Merge differences between two rev./tags' option and choose the 2 LAST merge
tags.

For example:

	cvs update -jmerge5 -jmerge6 (in directory D:\a\cvs_test\test\)
	cvs update: Updating .
	cvs update: Updating doc
	cvs update: Updating src
	M src/abc.txt
	RCS file: /cvs/test/test/src/abc.txt,v
	retrieving revision 1.1.2.6
	retrieving revision 1.1.2.7
	Merging differences between 1.1.2.6 and 1.1.2.7 into abc.txt

This way only differences between the last version and the last merged version (in branch)
will be merged into
